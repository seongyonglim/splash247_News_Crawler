Tight VLSFO supplies see ships swerve past Singapore,"July 7, 2022",https://splash247.com/tight-vlsfo-supplies-see-ships-swerve-past-singapore/,"For the first time in nearly two months, crude oil prices have fallen below $100 a barrel this week, yet in Singapore the price gap between high and low sulphur fuel oil – known as the Hi5 – remains at record highs, nudging towards $600 per tonne with ships in the region increasingly swerving away to other bunkering destinations.
The pricing gap between Singapore and Rotterdam, the world’s two largest bunkering hubs, is stark.
“VLSFO supply has been acutely tight for weeks in Singapore’s bunker market, with high price premiums quoted for prompt delivery dates,” a new report from bunker platform Engine states, adding: “Sources in Singapore’s bunker market point to a lack of incoming VLSFO cargo flows as a reason for the grade being tight.”
The situation is expected to remain tight throughout July with reports emerging of ships avoiding Singapore for bunker operations, something that could increase on quality concerns. Global testing firm Intertek Lintec on Tuesday issued an alert regarding flash points below the ISO 8217 minimum requirement of 60°C found in VLSFO bunker samples from vessels that have taken fuel in Singapore, the latest in a series of damaging bunker quality incidents hitting the republic this year. 
“It is the nature of the product and the inter-relationships with high priced transport fuels that is driving VLSFO prices so high, especially in Singapore. The position in the east is stronger than in the west, with exceptionally low diesel and gasoline exports out of India and China resulting in highly restricted supplies east of Suez,” a recent report from Integr8 Fuels pointed out.
This year’s growing price gap between shipping’s main two fuels is seeing a renewed interest in scrubbers.
Looking at the VLCC segment, Norwegian broker Fearnleys observed in its most recent weekly report: “The disparity between the scrubbered and unscrubbered vessels is stark.”
With a price differential close to double, a VLCC owner able to burn high sulphur fuel oil can look to earn around $27,000 a day for a Middle East to China run, according to Fearnleys. However, for the non-eco, non-scrubber vessels, on the same voyage, TCE returns are still struggling to break even.
Many will be eyeing the next dry dock as an opportunity to fit a scrubber and level the playing field
“Many will be eyeing the next dry dock as an opportunity to fit a scrubber and level the playing field,” Fearnleys predicted, something rival broker Clarksons also forecast in its latest weekly report, noting that thanks to the high fuel price differential, the share of global tonnage with a scrubber is set to grow to 24% by start 2023.
Prices for crude oil have dropped noticeably this week with growing fears about recession in many western countries. Not all shipping analysts are convinced that a plummeting oil price will be eagerly greeted by the shipping industry at large. 
“Shippers and shipping companies will normally agree that lower crude and bunker prices are to be preferred, however, right now most will probably be happy for crude to stay around $100 per barrel as much lower prices will be a reflection of adverse global economic developments that help no one,” BIMCO’s chief shipping analyst, Niels Rasmussen, commented today. "
VLSFO to HSFO price differential stands at record $538 per ton in Singapore,"June 13, 2022",https://splash247.com/vlsfo-to-hsfo-price-differential-stands-at-record-538-per-ton-in-singapore/,"Scrubber payback times are accelerating fast for those ships calling at the world’s largest bunkering hub, Singapore.
Very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) prices in Rotterdam are at $965 per ton and $1,149 per ton in Singspore. However, while VLSFO prices are rocketing, high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO or IFO380) prices are falling back, resulting in an ever-wider spread between compliant fuel oil and heavy fuel oil.
Owners with scrubber equipment now are able to reap the benefits of deltas ranging from $332 per ton in Rotterdam and $538.50 per ton in Singapore. This also means the divergences have never been bigger, with Lars Jensen from liner consultancy Vespucci Maritime putting these numbers in context last week.
The IFO380 average fuel price in 2019, prior to the low-sulphur rules, was $433 per ton. Now the premium for VLSFO alone is at the level of the full fuel price prior to IMO2020 and prior to the pandemic, Jensen observed in a post on LinkedIn.
“The prospect of a $700 per ton difference between VLSFO and HSFO, held out as a prospect by the scrubber manufacturers at the advent of the IMO2020 regulations, is starting to become more realistic by the day,” a markets update from broker Lorentzen & Co stated today.
High prices are not the only concern in Singapore. Fresh from a bunker contamination scandal, the Southeast Asian republic is facing further quality issues with FOBAS, the fuel testing unit of British class society Lloyd’s Register, issuing a warning that a number of VLSFO samples from Singapore have exceeded the 0.5% limit for water with the fuels in question found to have water ranging between 0.65% to 1.9%.
“Any carry over of water into the engine fuel rail has potential to cause damage to the fuel pumps, injectors and cylinder components as wekk as possible turbo charger surging and fouling,” FOBAS warned in an advisory.
Some 200 ships were hit hard by off-spec high sulphur fuel oil sold in Singapore by Glencore and PetroChina in February and March. The fuel was found to contain high concentration levels of damaging chlorinated organic compounds.

"VLSFO prices top $1,000, price gap widens massively in Singapore","May 27, 2022",https://splash247.com/vlsfo-prices-top-1000-price-gap-widens-massively-in-singapore/,"The global average price for very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) has shot up above $1,000 per tonne this week according to data from Ship&Bunker. Moreover, the price differential to high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) at Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub has spiralled to a record $359 per tonne, a gap that was just $80 at the end of April.
According to Steve Christy, research contributor at Integr8fuels, the gasoline, and middle distillate markets have led oil prices higher over recent weeks and although refinery margins are still very high, they are falling. Tightness in products is still the main price support, according to Christy.
The extreme price moves in Singapore – and the very sizeable Hi5 as the bunker price differential is known – is also down to the fact that HSFO prices have fallen with Russian volumes finding their way east rather than west. At Europe’s largest bunkering hub, Rotterdam, by contrast, the Hi5 is half that of Singapore’s.
The rise in crude oil prices that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine is clearly seen in bunker fuel surcharges being issued by containerlines. Across all trade lanes, the average fuel surcharges have risen close to 50%, reaching almost $600 per feu, according to container data platform, Xeneta.
“As bunker prices remain high, these surcharges are unlikely to fall any time soon, and some shippers will be seeing even higher surcharges,” an update from Xeneta this week suggested.

Surging oil demand sees VLSFO prices surpass $600 for first time since the start of the pandemic,"October 18, 2021",https://splash247.com/surging-oil-demand-sees-vlsfo-prices-surpass-600-for-first-time-since-the-start-of-the-pandemic/,"The price for very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) has crossed the $600 per ton mark for the first time since just after the global sulphur cap came into existence at the start of last year.
Oil prices are beginning the week on another hefty rise, following eight weeks of gains. Brent increased by 0.97% in early trading to $85.68 a barrel on the December ICE contract. WTI was up by 1.36% to $83.40  in the November Nymex market, the highest figure seen since 2014.
In Rotterdam, the price of VLSFO is now $606 per ton and in Singapore it stands at $ 622 per ton. February 2020 was last time VLSFO prices were in the $600 per ton territory.
Analysts at Norwegian shipbrokers Lorentzen & Stemoco noted today that as VLSFO prices march ahead, prices for high sulphur fuel oil are starting to lag, reopening the spread in the fuel types. In Fujairah, for example, the delta is over $100 per ton.
“That will comfort shipowners with scrubber installations able to save some $6,000 a day on VLCCs laden with crude consuming about 60 tons per day,” the analysts suggested in a note to clients today.
Latest data from Clarksons shows that in gross tonnage terms 23.9% of the global merchant fleet including the orderbook are fitted with scrubbers.

High black carbon emissions from VLSFO heaps pressure on IMO,"January 27, 2020",https://splash247.com/high-black-carbon-emissions-from-vlsfo-heaps-pressure-on-imo/,"Following on from a landmark study funded by the German Environment Agency that suggests some blends of the new very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) contain higher black carbon emissions than its forebear, high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is coming under pressure to ban the new fuel in Arctic waters.
“New hybrid fuels with 0.50% sulphur content used in the study contained a high proportion of aromatic compounds in a range of 70% to 95%, which resulted in increased [black carbon] emissions in a range of 10% to 85% compared to HFO,” the German study sent to the IMO claimed. The higher emissions were most noticeable when the engine was running at less than full capacity.
In the wake of the submission, which was supported by Finland, a number of NGOs are demanding the IMO takes swift action. The Clean Arctic Alliance has today called for the IMO to support an immediate switch to distillate fuels for ships in the Arctic and develop a global rule prohibiting fuels with high black carbon emissions.
“If immediate action isn’t taken by the International Maritime Organization, the shipping industry’s use of VLSFO – introduced to comply with the 2020 sulphur cap – will lead to a massive increase in black carbon emissions, and this will both accelerate the melting of Arctic sea ice and have a major impact on Earth’s climate,” said Dr Sian Prior, lead Aadvisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance.
Also demanding a fuel change today is John Maggs, senior policy advisor at Seas at Risk, who questioned  how VLSFO was allowed to be created in the first place.
“There are serious questions to be answered about how these blended super pollutant Frankenstein fuels ever came to market. It beggars belief that amidst a global climate crisis, the marine fuel industry could develop these VLSFOs without knowing their effect on black carbon emissions and the climate, particularly in the Arctic – especially as the IMO has spent almost a decade considering how to reduce black carbon emissions from shipping,” Maggs said today.
The Clean Arctic Alliance has written a letter containing the following questions to representatives of the marine fuel industry who prepared the definitive guidance on the supply and use of 0.5% sulphur marine fuel, to ask if they were aware that these new low sulphur heavy fuel blends had higher aromatic content, and if they were aware of the link between higher aromatic content in fuels and higher black carbon emissions?
“If the answer to the above questions is ‘yes’, then why did you not immediately seek to halt the production of these fuels and alert the IMO?,” the NGO questioned in its letter.
The letter was sent to IACS, IBIA, IPIECA, IMarEST, IUMI, OCIMF, and the Royal Institute of Naval Architects – all of whom have consultative status to the IMO. The letter was also sent to ARA, Concawe, CIMAC and JPEC. All of the organisations are named as co-authors of of the Joint Industry Guidance on the supply and use of 0.50%-sulphur marine fuel, published in August 2019."
VLSFO sediment issue goes global,"January 27, 2020",https://splash247.com/vlsfo-sediment-issue-goes-global/,"Veritas Petroleum Services (VPS) is warning clients that the issue of fuel instability leading to sediment formation in very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) has now gone global.
Splash has reported in recent weeks of high sediment being reported in VLSFO samples at European ports and the major bunkering hubs of Singapore and Houston. The situation is now believed to be far more widespread.
Between December 24 2019 and January 21, VPS has issued seven bunker alerts relating to sediment issues within VLSFO fuels. These bunker alerts show that sediment problems within VLSFOs is not restricted to a single port, or region, over this recent four-week period, as alerts have been issued in relation to fuel supplied in Singapore, Piraeus, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Miami and San Vincente.
Steve Bee, group commercial and business development director for VPS, stated, “I’ve never known such a concentrated frequency of bunker alerts to be issued in relation to a single fuel quality problem as we have seen with sediment problems in VLSFOs over the past four weeks.”
On January 3, Splash reported an alarming 60% of proposed blends for making 0.5% low sulphur fuel oil in Houston, America’s top bunkering destination, failed to meet sediment specifications, according to tests carried out by AmSpec Services, while FOBAS, the fuel verification company owned by class society Lloyd’s Register, has also issued recent similar alerts about non-compliant fuels cropping up in Europe and Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub.
The news is set to keep lawyers busy in the first weeks of the global sulphur cap era. Excess sediment blocks filters and can cause engine damage.
Beth Bradley, a partner at law firm Hill Dickinson, commented that the current marine fuel supply situation is looking like the “perfect storm” for litigators.
“There are a great number of issues which may radically impact on the liability situation. It’s gearing up to the perfect storm for litigators,” Bradley said.
Hill Dickinson has recommended that time charterparties and related bunker supply contracts should contain carefully worded provisions to clarify bunker specifications, sampling procedures and how the potential loss of time owing to inspections and de-bunkering operations is to be shared."
Coastal shipping along India’s east coast grinding to a halt on lack of VLSFO,"January 13, 2020",https://splash247.com/coastal-shipping-along-indias-east-coast-grinding-to-a-halt-on-lack-of-vlsfo/,"The IMO 2020 regulation has its first global trade scalp with news from south Asia where coastal shipping operations along India’s eastern coast risk grinding to a halt later this week due to the scarcity of low sulphur fuel oil.
“There is virtually no supply of low sulphur fuel oil and all the coastal ships including the feeder container vessels plying between Indian ports on the east coast will come to a standstill from this week as soon as they exhaust whatever little stock they had,” a top executive with a shipping company told the local Hindu BusinessLine today.
The looming fuel shortage was discussed in a tripartite meeting last week between government, refiners and owners.
India had repeatedly said last year it might not be in a position to comply with the global sulphur cap regulations, which started on January 1.
The situation on the west coast is better, the Hindu Business Line newspaper stated, due to the availability of the fuel in Kandla and Cochin for most coastal ships.
Splash is waiting for comment from a number of local feeder operators to confirm the fuel scarcity on the east coast.
Other nations have also hinted at a lack of available VLSFO in recent months, most notably the Philippines."
Beijing grants tax waiver on VLSFO exports,"January 13, 2020",https://splash247.com/beijing-grants-tax-waiver-on-vlsfo-exports/,"Beijing has given the green light to a tax waiver on exports of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) with Chinese refiners keen to take a significant global market share of the new fuel type.
Zhoushan, off Ningbo, is trying to position itself as a bunkering hub to rival Asia’s dominant Singapore with a host of bunker-related companies setting up in the area over the past two years.
Reuters reported on Friday that Chinese refiners will supply the new VLSFO to bonded storages along the country’s coast, and from there they will be retailed to ships by 12 licensed bunker dealers. Supplies to bonded tanks are considered as exports and will be managed by a quota system."
Fuel contamination spreads to Singapore,"August 8, 2023",https://splash247.com/fuel-contamination-spreads-to-singapore/,"The fuel contamination incident in Houston Splash reported on a month ago has now spread to Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub.
Fuel checker VPS reported a VLSFO contamination case at the Texan port on July 11, the largest bunkering hub in the Americas.
VPS detected the presence of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and associated isomers at significantly high levels in VLSFO bunker fuel deliveries in Houston from a single supplier for three months from March to May this year.
DCPDs are unsaturated chemical compounds which can make bunker fuel more sticky and viscous. Many vessels subsequently lost power and propulsion from the off-spec fuel.
VPS now states that 14 ships have taken on contaminated fuel which has caused damage, and while 12 of them bought the bunkers in Houston, two were topping up in Singapore. 
Multiple, multi-million dollar court cases were launched from the last big bunker contamination case in Houston three years ago."
Low and high sulphur fuel price spread narrows to lows not seen since 2020,"July 12, 2023",https://splash247.com/low-and-high-sulphur-fuel-price-spread-narrows-to-lows-not-seen-since-2020/,"The Hi-5 spread, the price differential between high and low sulphur oil, has narrowed to levels not seen since the end of 2020, the year that the global sulphur cap came into being. 
The price gap between the dominant two fuels in world shipping at the world’s top 20 fuelling hubs, as tracked by Ship&Bunker, stood at $81 per ton yesterday, a figure not recorded since the final week of 2020. 
The price spread has been incredibly volatile since the global sulphur cap – also known as IMO2020 – came into force on January 1, 2020. The all-time low was in October 2020 at $47.80 per ton, while the record high was hit in the middle of last year when scrubber-fitted ships enjoyed a massive $408.70 saving compared to rivals forced to use very low sulphur oil (VLSFO).
Year-on year, this week last year VLSFO was $990.70 per ton and now it is $594.33, a decrease of 40%. "

LNG bunker costs now competitive,"June 1, 2023",https://splash247.com/lng-bunker-costs-now-competitive/,"For the first time this year there is an economic case for owners of dual-fuel LNG ships to pay for some gas in their tanks. 
LNG has been the number one alternative fuel for ship orders for a number of years. Class society DNV’s latest estimates show there are 904 confirmed LNG-fuelled ships, including vessels on order. 
However, for much of the 2020s the price of LNG has been prohibitively high, meaning the vast majority of dual-fuel ships have been trading using traditional bunker fuel. 
Norwegian broker Lorentzen & Co noted this week that LNG used as bunkers is now “radically lower priced” than compliant fuel oil and on a par with heavy fuel oil. 
According to Ship&Bunker, LNG prices in Rotterdam are at $440 per ton, for the same energy equivalency as IFO380 bunker fuel. VLSFO in the same area stands at $531 per ton and HSFO at $431.50 per ton."
Seaspan ammonia-powered boxship design unveiled,"May 24, 2023",https://splash247.com/seaspan-ammonia-powered-boxship-design-unveiled/,"Working with Seaspan, the world’s largest boxship lessor, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping yesterday revealed the design of an ammonia-powered 15,000 teu container vessel.
The ship measures 350 m in length between perpendiculars and 53.6 m in breadth. Its design incorporates a dual-fuel engine that runs on very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and ammonia.
The unit sports an 11,600 cu m non-pressurised ammonia type B tank. It can run at 16 knots and travel 12,000 nautical miles, while the extended endurance of fuel gives it 18,500 nautical miles.
The project is connected to the SABRE Consortium, focusing on developing and demonstrating an ammonia supply chain in Singapore.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) is projecting ammonia will account for around 45% of the demand for marine fuels in 2050.
Last week, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the world’s largest containerline, tapped class society Lloyd’s Register, German engine manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions and Shanghai Merchant Ship Design & Research Institute (SDARI) for a design for the ammonia dual-fuel operation of a future containership."
Maritime CEO Forum: Crystal balling ships in 2030,"April 27, 2023",https://splash247.com/maritime-ceo-forum-crystal-balling-ships-in-2030/,"A shipowner, ship manager, class society, propulsion specialist, and technology provider led discussions this week at the Fullerton Hotel in Singapore for the Maritime CEO Forum to examine what ships will be coming out of yards at the start of the new decade.
Kicking off the session on how the global merchant fleet will look like in terms of propulsion, nuclear propulsion proponent Mikal Bøe, chairman and CEO of Core Power predicted that in 2030 the world will continue to complain that we’re not making much progress, that emissions will go up by a lot compared to today and that there will be no large commercial zero-emission ships on a well-to-wake basis with 75% of ships running on VLSFO, 20% on LNG and the remaining 5% on methanol as an additive to VLSFO.
David Barrow, vice president, of South East Asia, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore, told the audience it will be a mixture of fuels with carbon capture battery hybrids and even nuclear as an option. “The technology is there”, Barrow said, but noting that: “The issue with nuclear is you’ve got a whole different array of stakeholders to deal with.”
There are so many things you need to take into account what is going to be the leading fuel, Barrow said, highlighting pillars such as technology, policy and regulation, social aspects, and people aspect.
Susana Germino, general manager of decarbonisation and environmental compliance at Swire Shipping and Swire Bulk, does not see any major changes in ships by 2030 but stated that by that time they’d be more flexible with voyage optimisation, carbon capture and dual-fuel technology and also much more connected, pointing to data sharing, which today’s industry is lacking.
Germino also highlighted the energy efficiency technologies and stressed that when it comes to dual-fuel technology, “it is not about the fuel, it will be a multi-fuel industry.”
“Everything will be specific to the geographic regions where you want to operate and where technology and fuel is going to be available. If you need to use, let’s say, ammonia in 2040 and you’ll only have it in the Atlantic, you’re not going to have your vessel working in the Pacific,” she said.
In terms of nuclear, Germino added that she does not see ships moved by nuclear power but being absolutely necessary for the production of green fuels. “There is not enough green hydrogen for us and for other industries.” “I don’t expect any fantastically futuristic vessels until 2040,” she concluded, with the hope that Swire might at least have dual-fuel technology by 2030.
Ships in the near future will be a lot more connected. “I believe that this is something that is going to happen very easily and very fast. “The technology is there, it is not that we need to discover anything or invest. It is cheap, it is easy, anybody can connect the vessel,” said Eleni Polychronopoulou, CEO of METIS Cyberspace Technology who envisions north of 50% of ships with good connectivity onboard by 2030.
Commenting on the cost of investing in the new tech, Polychronopoulou added that “It is nothing compared to what is coming, the visibility that you get, the fact that you know what is happening onboard the vessel, especially with the lack of skilled crew. It is very important that you have full visibility of the vessel, to know exactly what is happening, when and why. You can do an easy root cause analysis with all this data, which would be very difficult otherwise.”
Rajesh Unni, CEO of Synergy Marine Group said the Singapore-based shipmanager has been working on several propulsion and decarbonisation options, including LNG, methanol, carbon capture, what to do with the captured carbon onboard, and batteries. Synergy is also heavily invested in collecting data from ships to improve efficiencies, but Unni said he doubts that would bring behavioral changes. “If all work onboard will be about collecting data, then, in my opinion, we create a faster caterpillar and not a butterfly,” he said, adding: The question is what to do with that data. You need to give people insights that help them change the way they behave and act. Only when that happens can you expect people to change. So, will shipowners or anybody else, even the ship’s staff, be happy to have visibility and data? Absolutely yes, but it is only when you turn that into insights.”
In terms of ship design by 2030, Unni sees wind-assisted propulsion and drag-reduction technologies coming.
Speaking from the floor, Kris Kosmala, a partner at Click & Connect and Splash columnist, said that for the ships of the future in 2030 to materialise, you actually have to have people ordering those ships.
“If I’m waiting five years to get a fully loaded green ship with the technologies and fuel that we know today, well then we are looking at 2029,” Kosmala pointed out.
“If there is no orders being placed for it, then the ship by 2030 is going to look pretty much like the ship today. It is still going to operate on bunker and is still going to carry a very sophisticated scrubber,” Kosmala said.
While bringing the session to an end, Swire’s Germino noted: “There are no zero-emission fuels; there are none. Even with nuclear, unless it is used on the ship, there will be some sort of emission associated with it. So, the only zero-emission ship that will exist in 2050 is a sailing ship without any engine.”
Further reports from the Maritime CEO Forum will be carried by Splash in the coming days. The next event in the series takes place at the Monaco Yacht Club in October.

Fuel magic and shipping’s third revolution,"April 24, 2023",https://splash247.com/fuel-magic-and-shippings-third-revolution/,"This newspaper told us a week ago that according to DNV there are 106 methanol-fuelled ships under construction or on order, of which 68 are containerships. I’ll amend that to dual-fuelled ships because not one shipowner is proposing to rely entirely on something other than very low sulphur heavy fuel oil to propel a ship.
There are slightly more LNG – and – VLSFO-fuelled ships than there are methanol – and – VLSFO – fuelled ships on order and under construction; there are fewer ammonia – and – VLSFO-fuelled ships on order and under construction and there are a couple of battery-powered ships and no nuclear ships on order and under construction. That’s it. Oh, there is a wooden sailing ship, also.
This tells us that there are many people who don’t want to decide about the fuel of the future, and that absolutely everybody wants to continue using heavy fuel oil. Anyone from outside the shipping trade might start wondering about mountains going into labour and giving birth to mice, to quote a Roman poet, because after years of wittering on about it we have, as the merchant shipping industry, done almost nothing to move ourselves off heavy fuel oil. Maersk tells us that it will have the first ‘carbon neutral’ containership, now being fitted out, in service by the summer.
Readers will have noted the calculation put forward by Harilaos Psaraftis of the Technical University of Denmark in this paper on April 4 under the title ‘The risks of regulatory complexity’ which in turn refers to an article by Sam Chambers on March 30 titled ‘Owners advised on new plays and pools in wake of EU carbon pricing regulations’, which discusses a paper put out by Lloyds Register and Ahti Consulting.
I suspect, gentle reader, that your reactions will be much like mine; “We have got to bestir ourselves and understand some rather difficult regulations if we are not going to lose more money than we have to, this isn’t going to be much fun, and perhaps that is what those clever folk in the Blue Building in Copenhagen are up to!”
Well, we can thank Splash for putting most of what we may need to know about the fuel regulatory aspects of the operation of ships into and out of the ports of the European Union in the years to come in one place. Note – this is just Europe. Other places may differ.
Incidentally, if you want to stem methanol for bunkers in the very European, environmentally aware, port of Rotterdam, you can do so. On 14 days’ notice. And that’s not green methanol; that’s the everyday stuff. I did spend a little time reading about green methanol and I found a three-year-old item in which a very well-known German industrial and chemical company announced that it was able to produce 10 litres of green methanol, per hour. I’m sure that Maersk and its friends in Danish shipping circles (that’s everybody in Danish shipping circles) have another source of green methanol, but if it were abundant, they would be selling it to the rest of us.
This is not the first time that the merchant shipping business has had to think hard about what ships and shipping are going to have to be like, in future. Between 1860 and 1880, ships changed from wooden sailing ships built from local trees on any convenient beach, to iron and steel triple expansion screw steamships, built in expensively equipped shipyards. Between 1960 and 1980 general cargo ship owners tried palletisation, tried roll-on, roll-off, tried Lighter Aboard Ship and finally concluded that containers were the answer.
There are things to think about here. Only two or three of the shipowners who dominated the shipping scene at the start of each of these revolutions was still around at the end of each of them, and in both cases the right answer was much the most capital intensive. We are now confronting revolution number three. The first two involved things that you could walk up to and pat. This one involves things we cannot see; the air we breathe and man-made regulations. We are going from a cheap, safe, fuel to one of several expensive and dangerous fuels.
Scared, yet?"
Maersk unveils video of keenly awaited methanol-fuelled ship,"April 18, 2023",https://splash247.com/maersk-unveils-video-of-keenly-awaited-methanol-fuelled-ship/,"Maersk has unveiled a video of its keenly awaited 2,000 teu, dual-fuel ship, which can run on either VLSFO or methanol, a landmark ship that has since opened the floodgates to many more methanol vessels being contracted at yards across Asia.
The ship was ordered two years ago and is due for delivery from Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in a couple of months for deployment in the Baltic.
The ship, emblazoned with ‘All the way to zero’ across its hull, has now moved from the drydock into the water for the first time.
“The launching was successfully completed at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and the construction is continuing,” commented Henrik Ekmann, head of newbuilding and retrofit at Maersk, adding: “Launching these mega structures takes precision and care, extensive product and design development from a large number of key suppliers and driven forward by our procurement and fleet technology teams.”
Maersk also has a series of 16,000 teu methanol dual-fuelled ships under construction in South Korea, and other liners have followed its lead.
It is now not just containerlines going for methanol as the preferred alternative future fuel, dry bulk and tanker orders are also in the mix as are a host of leading names in the cruise business.
Analysis from class society DNV shows methanol was the second most popular alternative fuel choice for newbuild orders last year after LNG. Of the 106 methanol-fuelled ships on order by the end of last month, as tracked by DNV, 68 of them are for containerships.

The ship was ordered two years ago and is due for delivery from Hyundai Mipo Dockyard this year, likely for deployment in the Baltic.
“I am very happy with the progress we are making on the project. We have now completed all key design-related milestones and production is progressing at full speed with delivery expected during summer. It has been a huge project, but we have succeeded not least due to great collaboration internally in Maersk and with our external partners,” said Ola Jakobsen, head of fleet technology at Maersk. 
Maersk also has a series of 16,000 teu methanol dual-fuelled ships under construction in South Korea, and other liners have followed its lead.
It is now not just containerlines going for methanol as the preferred alternative future fuel, dry bulk and tanker orders are also in the mix as are a host of leading names in the cruise business.
MAN Energy Solutions, one of the key engine suppliers for this type of propulsion, said last month that the interest in methanol as a fuel has surged and represents more than 30% of all its current, open pipeline projects across a broad range of vessel segments.
Analysis from class society DNV shows methanol was the second most popular alternative fuel choice for newbuild orders last year after LNG, with 35 ships ordered, bringing the total count to 82 ships. That tally has soared to cross the 100 mark this year.
We are thrilled to unveil the design of our first green fuel powered vessel . The build is on and it’s soon to be delivered by Hyundai Mipo Dockyard. Our feeder vessel has a dual-fuel engine and will be able to operate on green methanol. #Maersk #decarbonisation #alltheway pic.twitter.com/XMyP8cvOWd

Number of scrubber-equipped vessels to grow despite drop in fittings last year,"March 15, 2023",https://splash247.com/number-of-scrubber-equipped-vessels-to-grow-despite-drop-in-fittings-last-year/,"Despite a significant drop in the number of installations, the share of scrubber-fitted vessels is expected to increase in the coming years.
BIMCO reported 399 onboard installations last year, a 24% decrease year on year, with scrubbers now installed on 13% of bulkers, tankers, and containerships. This percentage is set to rise, as 17% of ships currently on the yard’s books are expected to have scrubbers installed.
Installing scrubbers allows shipowners to comply with current regulations while benefitting from the price differential between high sulphur fuel oil and very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). But BIMCO’s chief shipping analyst, Niels Rasmussen, noted that the price premium for VLSFO has turned out to be less than initially estimated.
“The lower-than-expected VLSFO premium has likely discouraged owners from installing scrubbers, particularly on smaller ships with lower bunker consumption and lower savings as a result,” Rasmussen said.
Since January 2020, the premium for VLSFO has averaged $149 per tonne, being as low as $50 per tonne for an extended period during 2020 and as high as $400 per tonne last June and July. “The higher the VLSFO premium, the more attractive the investment in a scrubber is because the payback period is shorter,” Rasmussen said.
In the long term, however, Rasmussen estimated the use of scrubbers to cut sulphur emissions may reduce “as decarbonisation efforts will increase the use of alternative fuels that are sulphur compliant”.

World’s first biofuel bunker price index launches,"January 31, 2023",https://splash247.com/worlds-first-biofuel-bunker-price-index-launches/,"New fuel mixes entering the shipping arena require pricing visibility to gain traction. Argus, a commodity price reporting agency, has today launched the world’s first independently assessed price for ship fuel that includes a biofuel component. The new B24 daily assessment reflects the market value of bunkers made up of 24% used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) and 76% very-low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), delivered-onboard in Singapore.
In Singapore, the world’s biggest bunkering hub, the B24 market is growing rapidly. Sales in 2022 were more than 140,000 tonnes, with trade accelerating over the last three months of the year.
Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: “The maritime industry is embracing the need to evolve and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our new B24 assessments are the world’s first biofuel bunker prices and bring vital transparency to this new and emerging market, which will play an increasingly important role while the industry transitions to develop cost-effective zero carbon solutions.”
With shipping facing an array of alternative fuel choices to choose from, data companies are rolling out many new price indices. Platts, for instance, has been covering methanol and ammonia prices since for the last 15 months."
Advanced biofuels can accelerate shipping’s decarbonisation without new infrastructure,"November 29, 2022",https://splash247.com/advanced-biofuels-can-accelerate-shippings-decarbonisation-without-new-infrastructure/,"Dr Nicholas Ball, CEO of XFuel, makes the case for greater use of biofuels today.
We are increasingly seeing a premium emerge for vessels that can demonstrate sustainability credentials. This however is set against a practical challenge. Many of the solutions currently being developed still face a number of technical and logistical issues. For larger ships looking to decarbonise and transition to low carbon fuels today, viable solutions remain limited, while the majority of options currently being examined will not only take time, but tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure investment. That investment is tentatively starting to flow, and infrastructure is starting to be built, but even under best-case timelines, shipping could take decades to decarbonise.
This is where second-generation biofuels can make a real difference decarbonising the sector by rapidly delivering cost-effective emissions reductions.
An industry-wide solution
New fuels and energy sources for shipping face significant logistical challenges that are yet to be overcome. One of these is rather obvious; if your ship arrives at a port and there is no methanol, ammonia, or hydrogen available, you can’t fill the tanks with VLSFO and carry on as normal. A shipowner or charterer has to plan ahead and, while infrastructure is in its infancy, there are very few options for port calls. This is perhaps one of the biggest factors holding shipowners back from investing in new engines today.
‘Drop in’ biofuels side-step this issue. A recent report by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) highlights the viable and valuable proposition brought forward by advanced fuels. The report argues such fuels offer marine fuel alternatives which can enter the market relatively quickly and help phase out fossil fuels.
The ‘drop-in’ characteristics of certain biofuels, offer the possibility to replace conventional fossil fuels without modifications to engines, fuel tanks, pumps or supply systems. This offers an immediate, flexible and cost-effective solution to the existing fleet, allowing vessels to decarbonise by reaching for those fuels or mixing biofuel bunkers with traditional VLSFO.
Some fuels, including XFuel’s marine ISO 8217:2017 compliant fuel, meet the same specifications as fossil fuels and can thus be used interchangeably or blended with fuels available at ports around the world.
Scaling globally
There is one key factor that has historically limited the ability of biofuels to act as a market-wide decarbonisation solution for an industry that uses as much liquid fuel as shipping: feedstock availability. However, new technologies and approaches are addressing the issue.
Feedstocks are the raw ingredient and biological building block of a biofuel. Those building blocks alone can dictate the sustainability and viability of a fuel.
For example, first-generation biofuels use crops as feedstocks, which could dramatically impact food supplies or ecosystems if scaled up to the kind of output required by the shipping industry. They are also exposed to volatile agricultural commodity markets. The above-mentioned limitations have limited the impact of traditional first-generation biofuels.
Second-generation biofuels were developed to overcome these limitations. Derived from waste, they represent a more sustainable alternative. But this alone does not deliver the scale that shipping needs.
Take the example of HVO. It uses waste feedstocks and delivers a more sustainable solution. However, the waste that these fuels rely on is scarce – making these fuels expensive and meaning that they cannot be produced in high enough quantities to create industry-wide change.
New technology has unlocked a more flexible and abundant feedstock: lignocellulose, or plant-based waste.
Lignocellulosic waste biomass is readily available across the world, and is derived from the waste produced by the manufacturing, building, agricultural, and forestry sectors. Such waste would otherwise be left to decompose or be incinerated.
When lignocellulosic waste is sourced sustainably and used to produce ‘drop in’ advanced fuels, these can represent an important part of the solution to shipping’s decarbonisation conundrum, while offering a product which is comparably priced to fossil fuel equivalent. These fuels offer a cost-effective and flexible carbon emissions reduction solution for shipowners, without relying on yet-to-be-built infrastructure.
Even when consensus on green ship propulsion does come, retrofitting and re-building the entire global fleet will take decades – and will leave polluting ships trading well beyond the IMO’s net-zero target dates. Sustainable biofuels therefore have a vital role to play; the ability to convert diverse and widely available waste feedstocks unlocks an entire, scalable sustainable energy market that was previously inaccessible."
Marubeni claims world’s first biofuel trial on ethylene carrier,"October 12, 2022",https://splash247.com/marubeni-claims-worlds-first-biofuel-trial-on-ethylene-carrier/,"Japanese trading house Marubeni Corporation said it has carried out a trial voyage on one of its chartered vessels using a marine biofuel blend, which to the best of the company’s knowledge was the world’s first biofuel supply to an ethylene carrier.
The 2020-built 
			GasChem Dollart, operated by GasChem Services, was bunkered with B25 marine biofuel, consisting of approximately 25% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) blended with very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) in Vlissingen, the Netherlands, for a voyage to Morgan’s Point, Texas.
The company said the FAME component of the marine biofuel blend used in this trial led to a reduction in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the voyage on a lifecycle, well-to-wake approach. 
Marubeni, which is one of the biggest players in the ethylene market with goals to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, said the trial was one of its steps to provide solutions to achieve decarbonisation.
In January this year, the company joined forces with Japan’s largest refiner, Eneos, to charter in an eco-friendly ethylene carrier over the long term from 2024. The ship is expected to be the first ethylene carrier equipped with a dual-fuel LNG engine built for ethylene export from Japan and be able to reduce CO2 emissions by roughly 40% compared to conventional ethylene carriers.
Commonly known as biodiesel, FAME is largely produced from recycled used cooking oils and renewable oil sources. The origin and production of the FAME used in this trial was certified by the ISCC system. The biofuel blend was delivered by BP."
New report highlights the millions of dollars in damages shipping faces every year from off-spec bunkers,"October 6, 2022",https://splash247.com/new-report-highlights-the-millions-of-dollars-in-damages-shipping-faces-every-year-from-off-spec-bunkers/,"A new 35-page report on bunker testing compiled by consultancy Thetius for class society Lloyd’s Register highlights the multi-million dollar losses shipping endures every year from off-spec fuel deliveries.
According to Thetius research, every year fuel suppliers globally deliver between 1m and 1.5m tonnes of off-spec fuel to vessels over 5,000 gt engaged in foreign trade. Of the off-spec or contaminated fuels that are detected, over 6,200 tonnes is debunkered at significant cost.
Data from a recent BIMCO and the International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA) survey published in May this year indicates that an average fuel oil quantity dispute costs $27,790, while fuel quality disputes average just over $54,000.
“Significant gaps remain where opportunities for poor fuel quality and off-quantity deliveries can gain and maintain a foothold,” the new Lloyd’s Register report states, a focus for much of the discussion going on at Sibcon, the world’s largest bunkering event, taking place in Singapore this week.
The recent BIMCO and IBIA survey showed 80.85% of respondents would prefer to bunker at a port with a bunker licensing program, despite 48.9% believing it would increase fuel prices at the port.
Likewise 94.15% of respondents in the survey said they would prefer to bunker from a supplier that has a mass flow meter installed and 79.79% would accept the supplier’s figures from a properly installed, certified and used mass flow meter. This positive response is despite 59.57% believing that it would increase fuel prices.
“This suggests that many customers are willing to pay extra for the protection and assurance afforded by a mass flow meter, which may offset suppliers’ high initial installation and purchase costs,” the authors of the Lloyd’s Register report stated, going on to add that professional testing and verification services are the only reliable way to protect seafarers, assets, and financial transactions from harm.
“Shipping cannot hope that supply side controls will eventually eliminate the problems from their risk registers without also making sound basic investments into protecting their own assets and interests. New standards and regulations will help those who also chose to help themselves,” the new bunkering report advised.
In March, Splash broke the story of a sprawling contaminated bunker scandal, which ultimately affected 200 ships, with the subsequent legal battles likely to run for years and cost millions of dollars.
Chlorinated compounds were found in many samples of fuel sold by Glencore and PetroChina, resulting in damage to fuel injection pumps, injectors, filter elements and purifier systems with many ships breaking down.
Singapore’s swift, comprehensive action in the wake of the scandal breaking drew praise, as has its commitment to use mass flow meters to ensure the right volumes of fuel are actually delivered – a piece of technology very few other bunkering hubs have engaged with.
“Despite the bunkering industry’s scale and the essential role it plays in supporting global maritime trade, much of it is still steeped in old-fashioned, outmoded operational practices. There is a continuing lack of transparency in the way marine fuel is delivered. This has to change,” argued Kenneth Dam, global head of bunkering at TFG Marine, in a post on the company’s website this summer. TFG Marine is a joint venture between Trafigura and John Fredriksen founded two years ago. Dam urged other leading bunkering hubs to follow the lead of Singapore and get mass flow meters installed as soon as possible.
A recent Blue Insight study assessed bunker deliveries at Rotterdam and Fujairah, the world’s second and third largest bunkering ports. It concluded that reported VLSFO bunker volumes at these two locations resulted in $250m in operating losses for suppliers across 2021 with bunker buyers being severely short-changed on volumes.
TFG Marine, which wants mass flow metes to be made mandatory globally, has joined with 50 other industry participants representing 2,000 vessels to appeal to the Rotterdam and the Antwerp port authorities to follow Singapore’s lead and introduce mandatory mass flow meter delivery in their jurisdictions."
Singapore to switch to electronic bunker delivery notes next year,"October 5, 2022",https://splash247.com/singapore-to-switch-to-electronic-bunker-delivery-notes-next-year/,"It’s been a tough year for Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub, fighting extreme price volatility as well as one of the worst off-spec scandals in more than a decade. Authorities are taking action.
At this week’s major bunkering conferemce, Sibcon, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) has announced plans to start registering sales of bunker fuel electronically over the next two years to improve efficiency and trade transparency and cut down on fraud.
The MPA will switch to electronic bunker delivery notes from physical documents next year, followed by a project to register oil flows digitally in 2024 using mass flow meters.
In March, Splash broke the story of a sprawling contaminated bunker scandal, which ultimately affected 200 ships, with the subsequent legal battles likely to run for years.
Chlorinated compounds were found in many samples of fuel sold by Glencore and PetroChina, resulting in damage to fuel injection pumps, injectors, filter elements and purifier systems with many ships breaking down.
The MPA ultimately laid the blame for the contamination outbreak on suppliers from the Middle East.
The fuel was traced back by the MPA to fuel purchased by Glencore in January and February this year. Glencore had purchased the fuel through Singapore-based Straits Pinnacle, which had contracted its supply from Unicious Energy. The contaminated HSFO was loaded at the Port of Khorfakkan in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) onto a tanker and shipped to floating storage facilities in Tanjung Pelepas, Malaysia to be further blended. The blended HSFO was subsequently delivered to storage facilities in Singapore.

Stena Bulk joins project to demonstrate end-to-end shipboard carbon capture at scale,"October 5, 2022",https://splash247.com/stena-bulk-joins-project-to-demonstrate-end-to-end-shipboard-carbon-capture-at-scale/,"The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) and Stena Bulk today initiated the first stage of a two-year, three-phase project to demonstrate shipboard carbon capture at scale.
Together with Alfa Laval, the American Bureau of Shipping, Deltamarin and TNO, the consortium will investigate onboard capture and storage, as well as offloading of captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to address the challenges and opportunities of deploying carbon capture technology on ships.
Project REMARCCABLE (Realising Maritime Carbon Capture to demonstrate the Ability to Lower Emissions) is the world’s first project aimed to demonstrate end-to-end shipboard carbon capture at scale.
While carbon capture technologies have been successfully used by OGCI’s member companies to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial operations, their use in the shipping industry is still in development.
In the largest project of its kind, targeting at least 30% absolute CO2 capture, or approximately 1000 kg/hr of capture, the seven-member consortium will build and test a marine carbon capture system onboard a Stena Bulk medium range (MR) tanker to assess the operational challenges of running such a system on a ship at sea.
Project REMARCCABLE will use non-proprietary equipment and processes, so results can be shared broadly and publicly to maximise learning and encourage further technology development. The project also aims to establish a pathway to reduce the cost of CO2 capture to 150 €/tCO2 or lower to allow the technology to be commercially deployed in future.
The initial demonstration will involve over 500 hours of capture of the exhaust from burning high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) or very-low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and will include offloading(s) of captured and liquefied CO2 (LCO2) at ports along the route of a 10-day deep-sea voyage. Following a successful test phase, Stena Bulk will retain the carbon capture system onboard and extend its use beyond this pilot.
Professor Lynn Loo, CEO of the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation, said: “GCMD views shipboard carbon capture as one of the mid-term solutions needed to help the maritime sector to decarbonise. The open sourcing of project REMARCCABLE, piloting under real-world conditions and delivering end-to-end solutions, is in line with GCMD’s goals of lowering the barriers for adoption so international shipping can meet or exceed the International Maritime Organization’s) GHG emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050.”"
How to balance trade-offs when decarbonising the shipping industry,"September 2, 2022",https://splash247.com/how-to-balance-trade-offs-when-decarbonising-the-shipping-industry/,"Christiaan De Beukelaer, a researcher at the University of Melbourne, on the tricky tightrope the industry must cross in its green pursuit. Christiaan’s book, Trade Winds: A Voyage to a Sustainable Future for Shipping, comes out in January.
The need to decarbonise the shipping industry is now abundantly clear. The path towards zero emissions less so. No silver bullet technology or fuel currently exists that can substitute for fossil fuels. The pathway to decarbonise the industry, which currently burns some 300 million tonnes of fossil fuels a year, thus lies in finding a balance between different approaches. The need to decide on the trade-offs this requires was, at face value, the key message of the inaugural Summer Institute on Maritime Decarbonisation at the World Maritime University in Malmö, which took place last month.
The question of trade-offs is what I wish to explore here, by adding some elements into the equation that never quite made it to the syllabus at the World Maritime University. Their summer institute focused primarily on lowering the energy intensity of ships and on the carbon intensity of fuels. Simply put, WMU academics focused mostly on the technical measures that can help shipping become more efficient, with some mention of operational measures and the regulatory environment. This focus is crucial, albeit insufficient.
In terms of ship design, reducing resistance and improving propulsion efficiency can help lower the energy intensity of ship operations. Though the gains of most of these interventions are relatively small, they can help slow emissions growth (relative decoupling). Indeed, despite commitments to the contrary, shipping emissions decreased by 1% during the first year of the pandemic (mostly thanks to an 8.8% drop during the first half of the year – and rebounded by 4.9% in 2021.
The most promising technological improvement to ships is to harness the wind aboard ships for direct (assistance with) propulsion. Retrofitting existing (and designing new) ships to embrace the millennia-old technology that never required burning fossil fuels should a top priority. Today, there is a variety of wind propulsion and assist technologies that have proven their economic and environmental worth and can be – and are – deployed easily.
Even when the potential of wind propulsion and marginal gains from reducing hull resistance and propulsion efficiency is fully exhausted, some mechanical propulsion will be needed for almost all ships. This means that zero-emissions fuels are needed.
The perfect fuel “zero emission” doesn’t quite exist, as the alternatives to fossil fuels come with trade-offs of their own. First, the amount of renewable electricity needed to generate enough power to propel all ships equals that of all the renewable energy currently generated in the world. Secondly, it is not enough to change what happen aboard ships: The necessary shore-based infrastructure for the production, storage, and delivery of alternative fuels amounts to nearly nine-tenths of the more than one trillion dollars needed to meet IMO’s existing targets. Third, a detailed analysis of the environmental cost (beyond carbon emissions) of any alternative fuel (and its production process and the materials needed for this) is needed to ensure the energy transition solves, rather than shifts, the problem. Fourth, any leakage of alternative fuels would cause great environmental harm; ammonia is highly toxic and would burn the lungs of humans and other animals, while hydrogen is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, making the environmental risk of slippage potentially disastrous. (I’m not even going into the risk of methane slippage from LNG, as this fossil fuel has no place in the energy transition – despite the current order book suggesting that many shipping executives think otherwise.)
In short, there really isn’t a silver bullet that will allow us to tackle the climate crisis by simply swapping one fuel for another. This is roughly as far as WMU’s Summer Institute on Maritime Decarbonisation went. To their credit, they covered an awful lot in a succinct manner. Though I was left with a big open question: Can more ambitious regulation speed up the transition?
The challenge the industry faces is far larger than the initial IMO target from 2018 might suggest. A 50% reduction in emissions by 2050 on a 2008 baseline brings them back to 1990 levels. That won’t do; they need to be reduced to zero well before 2050. The shipping industry’s remaining share of the global carbon budget to have a 66% chance of keeping warming below 1.5˚C was roughly 4.2-6.8 Gt in 2020. At current emissions levels of roughly one billion tonnes of CO2 a year, that leaves us with less than five years of business as usual.
So, what options do we have to deal with this enormous challenge?
The first thing is to push for far higher levels of ambition at the IMO. Targeting a 90% cut in emissions by 2040 would be a great start. Setting the bar any lower may mean that shipping companies do not feel sufficient pressure to invest now and use every possible technological and operational tool currently available.
The second thing is to embrace all the options currently available to curb fuel use immediately, by as much as possible. While this will obviously reduce total emissions from the industry, it will also stretch the very limited remaining carbon budget to give us a fighting chance at keeping warming below 1.5˚C. Even if that target is becoming more elusive by the day, every action that brings emissions down helps. And so does every tenth of a degree of warming we can avoid. This requires embracing slow steaming and wind propulsion – combined with any possible further gains to efficiency.
The less fossil fuel we need today, the less alternative fuel we’ll need in the future. More efficient ships will remain more efficient whether they run on HFO, VLSFO, Green Hydrogen, or Green Ammonia. The greenest fuel is the fuel we don’t use.
Efficiency wasn’t the elephant in the room during the Summer Institute. Indeed, wind propulsion, slow steaming, and the challenges inherent to “green” fuels were discussed at length. The significant thing that wasn’t? Money. The transition will cost money. A lot of it. But that won’t just increase costs for shipping companies, ship operators, cargo owners, and crews. It will also affect the end users of the cargos transported.
That is where the crux of the challenge lies: How can we ensure that balancing the trade-offs between technological innovation, operational measures, and rethinking supply chains doesn’t mean that people in “developing” countries face higher prices for cargo transport. If we can’t ensure a “just and equitable transition” that guarantees they won’t pay even more than they already do now, they might be hard-pressed to agree on greater ambition at the IMO. Without the support of these developing countries (which commonly pay more than rich countries for shipping, as UNCTAD continues to document), the revision of its “initial strategy” risks becoming too weak to push for a rapid transition. If that happens, we’ll all lose."

More crude tankers being taken on long-term charter,"August 16, 2022",https://splash247.com/more-crude-tankers-being-taken-on-long-term-charter/,"More and more crude tankers are being tied up on healthy three-year charters, a further sign of a strengthening market.
Brokers Braemar note in a new report that all sizes of crude tankers are now being sought on the period side. Moreover, with the price differential between HSFO and VLSFO fuels dropping, demand for non-scrubber ships is picking up.
Clarksons noted last week that average spot earnings for non-scrubber fitted VLCCs increased by 49% week-on-week to $23,307 a day, the highest level since September 2020, as position lists thinned, particularly in the west.
A five-year deal for a scrubber-fitted VLCC in the high $30,000s has been reported while business for suezmaxes is more brisk with younger eco ships getting $32,000 a day for three-year charters and aframaxes also performing similarly strong.
“There is faith in the market for the balance of the year and into 2023,” Braemar noted.
Splash has reported repeatedly on the firming tanker fundamentals in recent weeks with asset values on the rise.
Joakim Hannisdahl, who oversees the Cleaves Shipping Fund, wrote earlier this month of the start of the long-awaited cyclical expansion in oil tankers.
“We now see a dual positive effect on tanker demand due to implications from the invasion [of Ukraine] and from a general improvement in global oil supply,” Hannisdahl wrote, going on to discuss the very low orderbook.
The increase in willingness to take tankers for longer periods was picked up by Lars Barstad, the CEO of Frontline today.

Case made for global rollout of mass flow meters,"August 12, 2022",https://splash247.com/case-made-for-global-rollout-of-mass-flow-meters/,"A leading name in the bunkering industry has called for the global adoption of mass flow meters to improve transparency and quality in one of the most dubious areas of shipping.
“Despite the bunkering industry’s scale and the essential role it plays in supporting global maritime trade, much of it is still steeped in old-fashioned, outmoded operational practices. There is a continuing lack of transparency in the way marine fuel is delivered. This has to change,” argued Kenneth Dam, global head of bunkering at TFG Marine, in a post on the company’s website. TFG Marine is a joint venture between Trafigura and John Fredriksen founded two years ago. Dam urged other leading bunkering hubs to follow the lead of Singapore and get mass flow meters installed as soon as possible.
Precise mass flow measurement provides greater integrity through certified calibration and tamper-proof seals. Mass flow meters make use of the Coriolis effect to allow the flow of fluids and gases to be measured with a high degree of precision. When fitted to ships, mass flow meters produce computerised records of exact volumes delivered in real time. Both counter-parties have access to the same data.
The industry-wide average for mass flow meter adoption is less than 1%
Dam suggested there is an “inherent ambiguity” in the way bunker fuel has traditionally been delivered.
Marine fuels are supplied around the globe at different densities and in diverse atmospheric and climatic conditions. These variables have a significant impact on the quality and quantity of the bunker fuel supplied.
“Traditional delivery systems, which only monitor volume flow, cannot capture these differentials with any precision,” Dam pointed out. Suppliers and customers therefore rely on manual measurement and adjustment formulae to agree the specifications for every transaction.
“The complexity and opacity of this process makes it difficult to track and report transactions with confidence and accuracy,” Dam said, adding that it also leaves customers vulnerable to fraud and corruption.
Supplier malpractice takes many forms. It can include delivering fuel with high water, slops or air content, providing incorrect fuel temperatures or tampering with gauging, delivery equipment or paperwork to skew delivery data.
A recent Blue Insight study assessed bunker deliveries at Rotterdam and Fujairah, the world’s second and third largest bunkering ports. It concluded that reported VLSFO bunker volumes at these two locations resulted in $250m in operating losses for suppliers across 2021 with bunker buyers being severely short-changed on volumes.
Over a third of the TFG Marine fleet already has mass flow meter technology with more of its barges set to be mass flow meter-equipped over the next two years. That compares with an industry-wide average for mass flow meter adoption of less than 1%, according to Dam.
TFG Marine, which wants mass flow metes to be made mandatory globally, has joined with 50 other industry participants representing 2,000 vessels to appeal to the Rotterdam and the Antwerp port authorities to follow Singapore’s lead and introduce mandatory mass flow meter delivery in their jurisdictions.
The bunkering industry provides over 200m metric tonnes of marine fuel annually, a market that was worth $110bn globally in 2020 and is projected to reach $165bn by 2030."
Prax adds to bunker tanker fleet,"August 9, 2022",https://splash247.com/prax-adds-to-bunker-tanker-fleet/,"UK oil refiner Prax Group is expanding its bunkering fleet with the acquisition of the 2020-built product tanker

The 1,700 dwt Turkish-built vessel joins the company’s Harvest Energy Marine unit and follows on from the 2007-built Fortuna I, announced in January this year, which operates between Prax Lindsey Oil Refinery in Immingham, in the northeast of the UK, and Prax Terminals Belgium, in the port of Zeebrugge.
The 68 m long Fortuna II can carry very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and marine gas oil, and is able to supply bunkering services in ports right along the UK coast and in northwestern Europe.
“We are firmly committed to continuing to build a robust and reliable supply chain to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers right across the UK and northwestern Europe, in order to deliver innovative solutions to reduce refueling times at a competitive price, whilst simultaneously providing our customers with their most important resource,” said Geert Boden, general manager of Harvest Energy Marine.

LNG bunker prices near record high,"August 8, 2022",https://splash247.com/lng-bunker-prices-near-record-high/,"Oil prices dropped 10% last week to levels not seen since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. In the bunker markets, this has been reflected by an ever greater margin in pricing between traditional fuels and LNG with the latter now on course to hit record highs soon, with many of today’s LNG dual-fuelled ships deciding not to take on gas.
For LNG bunkers in Rotterdam priced by Ship & Bunker on an energy equivalency of one metric ton of IFO380 bunkers, meaning HSFO, prices are currently hovering at $2,621 per ton, threatening to eclipse former records of $2,673 per ton set this March.
LNG bunker sales in Rotterdam plunged 43% lower in Q2 to just 63,000 cu m. Sales of the gas fuel had been on a steady rise for years through to the start of this year when the pricing gap with conventional fuels made them uneconomic.
Despite the drop recorded in Rotterdam, Europe’s top bunkering hub, LNG bunker sales globally have been ticking up in recent months, according to online platform BunkerEx.
“What has surprised us is the number of suppliers seems to be increasing too, which is a key component to make LNG truly competitive with other fuels,” Ishaan Hemnani, BunkerEx’s CEO, told Splash today.
“We are seeing a little more demand, but that’s probably just the market building out or people expecting the spread to get even worse come winter,” Hemnani added.
Latest data from shipping classification society DNV suggests that the global LNG-fuelled fleet has expanded by nearly 60% over the past two years, with 304 vessels now in operation.
Around 4.5% of the global fleet by tonnage – or 1% of ships by numbers – is alternative fuel capable, mostly LNG, according to Clarksons Research.
Clear figures on how many of these 300+ dual-fuelled ships are using LNG today remains opaque.
A spokesperson from Integr8 Fuels’ research department commented: “Most owners of dual-fuel tonnage buying on the spot market are likely purchasing VLSFO/LSMGO as indeed the differential is not in favour of LNG. Some of these would still bunker LNG as a one-off for marketing purposes and we’ve seen a few press releases about it recently. Some would probably have some kind of take or pay contracts that tie them up to buying it anyways while others will be lifting in US where LNG bunkers are more competitive, particularly compared with LSMGO.”
The majority of dual-fuel owners will have switched to conventional fuels given the price gap, the spokesperson stressed.
“Being alternative fuel capable or ready is nothing but an expensive, non-committal greenwashing exercise as long as everyone with dual-fuel engines burns fuel oil anyway,” argued Roar Adland, shipping professor at the Norwegian School of Economics, in a widely read recent post on LinkedIn."

Global drop-in biofuels pilot project launches,"July 26, 2022",https://splash247.com/global-drop-in-biofuels-pilot-project-launches/,"The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) is leading a consortium of 18 industry partners to launch a drop-in biofuels pilot project with a combined contribution of $18m in cash and in-kind to establish an assurance framework for ensuring the supply chain integrity of current and future green marine fuels.
On the launch of this pilot project Professor Lynn Loo, CEO of GCMD, said: “GCMD is leading this route-based pilot to help align stakeholders in the supply chain for the adoption of biofuels. By facilitating and creating an optimised drop-in green fuels supply chain, this pilot will help to shape national and international standards of biofuels bunkering and lower the barrier for their wider adoption to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a lifecycle perspective. In curating and executing this first-of-its-kind drop-in biofuels pilot, GCMD is positioned to address stakeholder pain points in the complexities of the supply chain of green marine fuels in a meaningful way.”
To meet the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation targets, shipowners as well as cargo owners and charterers are exploring the purchase and use of green fuels.
Biofuels can be a near-term measure to reduce GHG emissions as they are available today, and they can be deployed in the same way as marine fuels with minimal changes to the existing distribution infrastructure, shipboard technologies, and operational norms of ships. However, there is no industry-wide assurance framework that addresses concerns on the quantity, quality and GHG emissions abatement of biofuels, nor one that safeguards their premium and value. To address this gap, the GCMD-led pilot aims to establish an assurance framework that ensures supply chain transparency of drop-in biofuels, whose applicability can be extended to future drop-in fuels, such as bio-LNG, bio- methanol and green ammonia, when they become available in meaningful quantities.
Recent IMO decisions to eliminate the need to apply for waivers for using fuel blends with up to 30% biofuels (B30) for propulsion, and to allow the use of B30 in accordance with MARPOL Annex VI, have lowered regulatory hurdles for adopting biofuels. To this end, the assurance framework that will be the outcome of this pilot will increase stakeholder confidence in the full value of the premium paid for such green fuels, and further lower the barrier to wider adoption of biofuels in the maritime industry by addressing concerns on the integrity of the biofuels supply chain.
The vessels in this pilot are all equipped with MAN ES’s two-stroke engines.
GCMD is undertaking a bottom-up approach by convening like-minded partners across the maritime industry to participate in this pilot. Altogether, the shipowners, charterers and operators participating in this pilot project represent approximately 2,300 vessels across the container, tanker and bulker segments. With 12 vessels bunkering at three ports across three continents, the learnings from these route-based pilots will support the green corridors framework that was put forth by the Clydebank Declaration at COP26 in November last year, of which 24 states are signatories including Singapore, the Netherlands and the US where bunkering ports for this pilot project reside.
A first-of-its-kind in extent and complexity, the pilot aims to optimise the entire supply chain of bunker fuels by building on the learnings of past shipboard trials involving biofuels. Designed through the lens of the shipowner, piloting will start with fuel blends involving existing biofuels, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) blended with either very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) or marine gas oil (MGO) in blends up to 30% biofuels (B30).
Using BunkerTrace’s digital and synthetic DNA tracing products to track marine fuels from production to vessel propulsion, the pilot will validate the authenticity of sustainable biofuels through molecular verification tests conducted on fuel samples that are collected at numerous identified points along the supply chain. Hence, the pilot will address traceability of drop-in biofuels from production, distribution, transportation, storage, and bunkering to shipboard application, providing end-to-end supply chain transparency.
Testing these fuel blends across the container, tanker and bulker segments travelling on fixed and tramp routes and bunkering at the ports of Singapore, Rotterdam, and Houston under business-as-usual conditions will demonstrate the compatibility and stability of these biofuels in actual operating environments.
In an effort to further accelerate biofuels adoption as a near-term measure to reduce GHG emissions, GCMD will be leveraging this project to be the first in trialling and assessing the use of crude algae oil (CAO) as a marine fuel. CAO is a third-generation biofuel that promises substantially reduced carbon footprint, but unlike HVO and FAME, its utility has not been tested nor its supply chain established.
The overall pilot will commence on August 1, and is expected to take 12 to 18 months to complete."
Challenging conventional thinking on implementing clean tech,"July 18, 2022",https://splash247.com/challenging-conventional-thinking-on-implementing-clean-tech/,"There isn’t time to install clean technologies one at a time, and it doesn’t make sense to do so, argues Tuomas Riski, the CEO of Norsepower.
The maritime industry’s clean technology market has often been characterised by investments in a single technology with the value of the purchase being largely based on its promised payback period. It’s a mindset that has worked well enough in the past when there were limited options and cost reductions were the single focus of an initiative.
That’s not to say that stemming rising fuel costs isn’t an issue – quite the opposite. We’ve recently seen the price of VLSFO again exceed $1,000 per tonne but cutting fuel costs is not the only form of payback to consider when emissions regulations are tightening, sometimes on an annual basis. We also need to plan for high-priced new fuels, carbon taxes, port incentives, charterer requirements, new IMO regulation, and cargo owner demands for decarbonisation.
But, as Gavin Allwright, secretary of the International Windship Association, said recently: plug in ship efficiency measures, digitalisation, and other investments that can be delivered in the short-term make the future look much brighter.
A 360-degree view is needed to combine new technologies as favourably as possible, because the greatest fuel and emissions savings are actually the combined result of operational strategy, optimised design and clean technologies.
For example, the crew of roro SC Connector decided to take the wind forecast into account when planning routes, and in doing so they have been able to use Norsepower’s Rotor Sails to save 4.6 tonnes of fuel and 14 tonnes of CO2 emissions during a single voyage from Rotterdam to Tananger, Norway. The vessel achieves an average reduction of fuel consumption, fuel cost and carbon emissions of up to 25%, and the two Rotor Sails have generated a maximum thrust force equivalent of 8 MW propeller shaft power.
In addition to rotor sails, the ship has been fitted with a battery container, which balances peaks of electricity demand when accelerating the Rotor Sails. So, our installation on the SC Connector actually involves multiple clean technologies – working together to achieve optimal performance.
This is just one example. Combining rotor sails with technologies such as optimised propeller technologies, power management systems, hull and energy optimisation, propulsion drive train products, power take off and take in (PTO/PTI) systems, and energy storage systems can deliver tangible value and economies of scale.
However, there are challenges holding the industry back from taking a 360-degree view of combining innovation onboard. The clean technology installation process needs simplifying at each stage, including for planning dry-dock installations or during builds.
Globally, shipyards are currently inundated with projects and technology installations and ship builds are consistently delayed. Shipowners and fleet operators should be able to obtain instant quotes for integrated retrofit works, have real-time visibility of shipyard availability and easily access and schedule dry dock slots.
Relationships and collaboration between technology providers and shipyards are also essential so shipowners and managers can access the technology needed to make impactful savings and install the technology combination which is most suited to their vessel’s profile.
It’s not just external barriers that need to be overcome. Breaking siloed thinking around operational performance and data use within shipping companies will ultimately result in more joined up strategic thinking that will filter down and drive implementation.
For changes to come to fruition, shipping’s commercial dynamics must also re-adjust. In addition to financiers recognising that payback algorithms are becoming antiquated, outdated charter party agreements also need updating. Building greater understanding amongst charterers about the value of incentivising the use of clean technology onboard vessels and ‘rewarding’ innovative operators by guaranteeing longer term charter party agreements at attractive rates will go far to help solve the all-too-familiar split incentive conflict. Anomalies such as ‘rush to wait’ charter party clauses that are counter-intuitive to optimising voyages and decarbonisation should be relegated to the past as part of this progressive and collaborative spirit.
Taking this more holistic approach means we rewrite the rule book, whether it is commercial agreements between shippers, defining new payback structures with financiers or exploring co-operative arrangements between tech firms. We see a gradual willingness across the industry to invoke these changes but real impact will only happen when we scale up, and speed up the process."

Rio Tinto and BP launch one-year biofuel trials,"May 23, 2022",https://splash247.com/rio-tinto-and-bp-launch-one-year-biofuel-trials/,"Mining giant Rio Tinto will be working with BP on a one-year biofuel trial to help reduce carbon emissions from its fleet. Under the deal, BP will be supplying biofuel for Rio Tinto’s 2013-built capesize bulker 
			RTM Tasman on a mix of Transatlantic and Atlantic-Pacific routes, in what is said to be one of the longest-duration marine biofuel trials to date. 
The extended trial agreement follows a journey on the RTM Tasman after it refuelled with biofuel in Rotterdam in March 2022 for the first time and then picked up its first load of the trial at the iron ore company of Canada’s Sept-Îles port in Quebec in April. All biofuel refuelling during the trial will be at Rotterdam. The trial is using a BP-manufactured B30 biofuel blend composed of 30% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) blended with very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). This B30 biofuel blend is said to reduce lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by up to 26% compared to standard marine fuel oil. 
Working with BP and the ship managers, Anglo Eastern, the trial will analyse a series of engine and fuel performance factors, including engine efficiency and fuel consumption, corrosion and degradation, microbial growth, temperature impact, fuel switching impacts and fuel stability. 
Rio Tinto has set an ambition to reach net-zero emissions from shipping its products to customers by 2050 and to introduce net-zero carbon vessels into its portfolio by 2030. According to its head of commercial operations, Laure Baratgin, sustainable biofuels have the potential to be an important transition fuel on the way to net-zero marine emissions, and a longer-duration trial should provide important information on their potential role and wide-scale use.

Gibsons argues Baltic Exchange VLCC benchmark is no longer relevant,"May 16, 2022",https://splash247.com/gibsons-argues-baltic-exchange-vlcc-benchmark-is-no-longer-relevant/,"UK shipbroker Gibsons has argued that the Baltic Exchange’s VLCC benchmark is in need of an urgent update to better reflect the makeup of today’s supertanker fleet.
Spot VLCC earnings were in the negative territory for most of last year, with the key benchmark TD3C averaging minus $250 a day on a slow steaming, non-scrubber, non-eco basis. So far this year, returns have been equally disappointing, only creeping up to zero last month.
With benchmark earnings so low for so long, some tanker analysts have wondered why the sector has not seen meaningful increases in demolition activity.
In part, an answer to this lies in a high uptake of the scrubber technology in the VLCC sector, Gibsons suggested in its latest weekly report. According to Gibson’s database, around 42% of existing VLCCs have been fitted with exhaust gas cleaning technology, with a standard scrubber-fitted 10-year-old tanker earning on average just over $6,000 a day more than a similar non-scrubber vessel last year. The scrubber premium has increased in 2022, in line with increases in bunker prices and the widening gap between HSFO and VLSFO prices. So far this year, scrubber-equipped VLCCs have earned around $11,000 a day more on the spot market, a premium over a non-scrubber tanker wide enough to cover opex.
Apart from scrubber equipped VLCCs, another 11% of internationally traded VLCCs are built in 2015 or later, meaning that those vessels are likely to be of an eco design, hence being able to generate higher returns due to lower bunker consumption. Furthermore, there are also quite a few non-scrubber fitted tankers, mainly around 20 years of age, trading sanctioned Iranian and/or Venezuelan barrels. These vessels account for 11% of the existing VLCC supply and operate outside the international market, at a notable premium compared to mainstream industry earnings.
“Evidently the majority of the VLCCs trading on the spot market are capable of generating higher returns than the benchmark Baltic Exchange VLCC description,” Gibsons observed.
Furthermore, with more newbuilding VLCCs to be delivered and some ships yet to retrofit, going forward the trading fleet will increasingly become eco and/or scrubber fitted.
“So, this begs the question, is it now time to assess benchmark VLCC earnings on a different basis?” analysts at Gibsons mused."
Norden rolls out biofuel offering,"April 7, 2022",https://splash247.com/norden-rolls-out-biofuel-offering/,"Norden has launched what it calls a 100% carbon neutral biofuel sailing option for customers. The Danish owner and operator said the biofuel sailing is the first in a range of green freight products to be rolled out this year as part of the company’s transition to zero-carbon shipping by 2050.
The company has secured a supply of biofuel made from waste cooking oil and is said to be in discussion with several customers over the first carbon-neutral freight deal. “We believe there is a growing demand for carbon-neutral transportation from our customers – particularly those with ambitious sustainability goals,” said Adam Nielsen, head of the logistics and climate solutions division.
Norden said it opted for biofuel over other eco fuels because it can be used onboard existing vessels without any modifications to the current engine design. The goal is to scale up the biofuel offering as global production becomes more advanced and biofuels can be developed from new alternative sources, the company added.
“We see biofuel as a very important transition fuel on our journey to zero-carbon shipping as it can be used on board our current vessels to make an immediate reduction on carbon emissions,” asserted Henrik Røjel, head of decarbonisation at Norden.
In related news, Japanese containerline Ocean Network Express (ONE) has provided details of its latest trial of marine biofuel onboard the 4,538 teu 
			NYK Fuji. The 2011-built ship was refuelled with 1,300 metric tonnes of marine biofuel product during bunkering at Port of Singapore that was consumed in 45 days while deployed on ONE’s SAS service. The trial started on February 21, after the vessel passed the Malacca Straits, sailing onwards to the ports of Durban and Cape Town, before returning to Southeast Asia.
The biofuel product used was a blend of brown grease methyl ester (BGME), a type of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), with very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). “The trial required no modifications to marine engines or fuel infrastructure and showed that marine biofuel product can be considered a ‘drop in fuel’ that can help to reduce emissions in shipping,” ONE said."

MSC takes bunker surcharge action,"March 15, 2022",https://splash247.com/msc-takes-bunker-surcharge-action/,"Mediterranean Shipping Co (MSC) has become the first liner major to take action against the extraordinarily volatile fuel bills it is facing, announcing yesterday its fuel surcharges will be reviewed on a fortnightly – not monthly – basis from the middle of next month for all spot and quarterly contracts on Asia trades.
“The current global political situation is creating major, and unpredictable, fluctuations on global fuel prices,” MSC, the world’s largest containerline, stated yesterday. The new fuel surcharge changes will become effective from April 15.
Fuel prices have been rising for many months. Back in the summer of 2008, a couple of months ahead of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis, the average price for IFO 380 fuel, then the dominant shipping fuel, at the world’s top four bunkering hubs averaged $739.25 per tonne. The day before Russia invaded Ukraine last month low sulphur fuel (VLSFO) prices at the same four ports – as tracked by Ship&Bunker – stood at a new high of $741. They have since leapt dramatically, crossing the the $1,000 per tonne mark for the first time in history at key bunkering hubs eight days ago as commodity prices spiked across the board in the wake of the war with the price of Brent crude topping the $130 per barrel mark earlier this month. High sulphur fuel oil also crossed the $700 mark at the same time.
In recent days, bunker prices have climbed down with the latest Ship&Bunker data for the top four bunkering hubs showing an average price of $922.50.

Contaminated fuel warning in Singapore,"March 9, 2022",https://splash247.com/contaminated-fuel-warning-in-singapore/,"Not only are bunker prices at record highs in Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub, the quality of fuel on offer has come in for heavy criticism of late.
Splash has been alerted to multiple off spec bunker deliveries over the past four weeks. Japan’s largest shipowner by dwt, Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL), for instance, has been the victim of three consecutive poor quality bunker deliveries in Singapore in recent weeks, one of which knocked out the power for a number of days on a giant scrubber-fitted, HSFO-consuming valemax called Global Harmony.
It is not just HSFO that has had contaminants recorded recently. Splash has seen a note from Veritas Petroleum Services to clients warning of high sediment content in multiple fuel samples it has tested on VLSFO in Singapore recently.
The aluminium and silicon levels of these samples indicate that the fuels contain elevated levels of highly abrasive particles that could cause accelerated wear of diesel engine components, VPS warned.

Bunker prices top $900 in Singapore and Fujairah,"March 4, 2022",https://splash247.com/bunker-prices-top-900-in-singapore-and-fujairah/,"Bunker prices at the two of the world’s largest bunkering hubs have shot past the $900 per tonne mark for the first time ever. Prices in Fujairah, the world’s third largest bunkering port, hit $918 today, while they stood at $904.50 in Singapore, the top bunkering hub in the world, with Ship&Bunker’s overall global average price at a record high of $885.50.
Bunker fuel prices have been on the rise since bottoming in the summer of 2020, but have accelerated rapidly to new record highs as global oil prices are now over $110 per barrel. Sanctions against Russia as well as general geopolitical uncertainty and tensions have sent Brent prices to the highest level since 2014. The price of very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) is up 35% since the beginning of the year, and the fuel spread between VLSFO and HSFO is now over $200 per tonnne.
A new report from Braemar ACM noted that since the implementation of IMO 2020, the spread between VLSFO and HSFO has widened each year, and forward pricing at current levels suggests this will persist through 2022 and into 2023. Despite the largest spreads in these fuels coming in early January 2020, at $370.30 per tonne, the average spread for the year totalled $96.60. In 2021, this increased by 20.4% to $116.3. More recently, the bunker price spread has further widened, averaging $216 per tonne so far in 2022, 85.7% higher than in 2021.
“Forward prices indicate these levels are likely to drop off modestly in 2022, averaging at $189.4/t, but still significantly higher than previous years’ levels,” Braemar ACM stated (see chart below).
Analysts at investment bank Jefferies have also been looking at the impact of today’s sky-high bunker prices.
“Owners operating in the spot market on voyage charters are more exposed to rapidly rising bunker prices, especially in the short run. That said, owners will demand higher rates over time to compensate for rising fuel costs and new rate floors will be established,” a report from Jefferies pointed out, going on to highlight how ships with scrubbers installed will profit from the $200+ fuel price gap.
Looking at the impact on the container trades, Lars Jensen, CEO of consultancy Vespucci Maritime, detailed via LinkedIn that container carriers use some 60m tons of fuel per year. This means the total fuel cost has increased by $37m per day since the start of the year, equating to $80 per teu.“[S]ubstantial BAF increases are coming,” Jensen warned today.

Bunker prices hit all-time highs,"February 23, 2022",https://splash247.com/bunker-prices-hit-all-time-highs/,"With Russian tanks entering eastern Ukraine yesterday, bunker prices have hit an all-time high.

At Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub, the price for low sulphur fuel hit $758 per tonne with the price gap to high sulphur fuel staying stubbornly above $200 per tonne.
Bunker prices for VLSFO have been climbing for many months and today stand 57% higher than they were 12 months ago.
With refiners prioritising gasoline and diesel production over bunkers because of strong demand, analysts are anticipating VLSFO prices could rise further.
Moreover, the price of crude, touching $100 a barrel, is predicted to remain at elevated prices for most of 2022.

Bunker prices near all-time highs,"February 15, 2022",https://splash247.com/bunker-prices-near-all-time-highs/,"The cost of bunker fuel for the majority of commercial ships trading today is just $10.75 per tonne away from the all-time highs recorded in July 2008 with shipping warned to expect high fuel bills for the duration of 2022 and into next year.
With the price of crude edging close to $100 per barrel in recent days, spurred higher by the possibility of conflict between Russia and Ukraine, bunker prices have been soaring, with a tonne of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) yesterday going for $748 in Singapore, the world’s top bunkering hub. The price gap between low and high sulphur content fuel has also shot up above $200 per tonne in Singapore in recent days.
Back in the summer of 2008, a couple of months ahead of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis, the average price for IFO 380 fuel, then the dominant shipping fuel, at the world’s top four bunkering hubs averaged $739.25. Today’s VLSFO prices at the same four ports – as tracked by Ship&Bunker – stand at $728.50 per tonne.
“The projected divergent trends in high and low sulphur marine fuels suggests that the VLSFO – 380 Cst spread could well rise widen from today’s $210/mt (basis Singapore) level going forward,” new analysis from BRS this week predicts.
The global fuel mix for shipping is also changing thanks to the sky high prices for LNG.
Data from Integr8 Fuels shows how LNG has lost its price competitiveness to marine gasoil (MGO) – and thus to a greater extent VLSFO – resulting in LNG vessel operators minimising the use of boil-off, which has now more value as cargo, and increasing purchases of VLSFO and MGO.

Owners brace for a year of high bunker bills,"January 26, 2022",https://splash247.com/owners-brace-for-a-year-of-high-bunker-bills/,"Shipowners have been warned they will need to relook at fleet deployments plans for the year ahead with the industry braced to shell out far greater sums in bunker costs.
Bunker prices, already the highest they’ve been since 2012, are widely tipped by many senior executives polled by sister title Splash Extra to remain at severely elevated levels all year, leading to a greater swathe of the world merchant fleet deciding to slow steam where possible and forcing the hand of many vintage units towards demolition.
The price for Singapore very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) bunker fuel has jumped 6% so far this year from $640 per ton to $680 yesterday.
“Elevated bunker prices are here to stay, and the VLSFO-HSFO fuel spread is likely to remain wide. It’s good for scrubbers,” said Randy Giveans, senior vice president of equity research at investment bank, Jefferies.
“We expect this will keep average speeds relatively low and will also incentivise scrapping of the older, less fuel-efficient fleet,” Giveans said, adding: “In this high-priced bunker fuel environment, you want eco-ships, ideally with scrubbers, and we expect those vessels to massively outperform anything over 10 to 15 years of age.”

Business and (some) governments emerge as new agents of shipping’s climate change,"November 19, 2021",https://splash247.com/business-and-some-governments-emerge-as-new-agents-of-shippings-climate-change/,"Alisdair Pettigrew from BLUE Communications on the change of mood among shipping CEOs witnessed at COP26. 
Glasgow, Saturday 6th November. The International Chamber of Shipping event Shaping the Future of Shipping may not be a date that signalled a turning point in thinking within shipping and its approach to decarbonisation. But for those that attended, there was some consensus – among a predominantly middle-aged, white male, blue-suited audience: this was a seminal day.
CEOs from the world’s major containerlines stood up and stated, one after the other, their encouragement that change is needed in the form of a $300 per tonne carbon levy, an R&D fund, and a target of net zero by 2050. This collective decisiveness is not what shipping has been accustomed to; feeling uneasily unrepresentative of years of elongated technical discussions at IMO around wording of documentation that did not include the ‘D’ word – decarbonisation. 
To quizzical expressions, a spirit of dramatic change purveyed. Tanker shipping routes, for decades shaped by the transport of fossil energy from source in the Middle East or the US Gulf, would be usurped and replaced by…wait for it…Chile. Why Chile? Well, as the energy minister for Chile explained to the audience, Chile is ideally placed to be the source of seemingly abundant green hydrogen. Shipping, he proclaimed, we’re here for you. 
Shipping would, according to the minister, be the first in line to receive this new low carbon source of energy. No longer, so we were told, would shipping be the last in line – the happy recipient of the highly polluting, waste, residual product Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), or its more recent form, Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) (don’t be fooled though, the ‘very low’ still equates to 500 times the sulphur level of the average car in the EU).
But why this new progressive mindset from the container market, which represents approximately 13% of the world’s ocean-going vessels, and over 50% of the industry’s approximate 1 billion tonne carbon footprint? The answer: Amazon, IKEA, and Unilever. To name just a few of the liner market’s biggest customers. 
They, along with Brooks Running, Frog Bikes, Inditex, Michelin, Patagonia, and Tchibo are the first signatories to the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels (coZEV); a new coalition with an ambition statement of zero carbon shipping by 2040. “The time to act is now and we welcome other cargo owner companies who want to lead on addressing climate change to join us in collaboration,” said Edgar Blanco, Director, Net-Zero Carbon at Amazon. Jeff Bezos was evidentially unavailable for comment.
L’espirit de changement continued as COP26 veered to an inconclusive close, with the Clydebank Declaration, launched by 19 states with the aim of setting zero-emission maritime routes between two or more ports. The critical aim is to get 5% of the vessels to net zero by 2030, and set a pathway to net zero by 2050. The signatories agreeing an objective of setting up ‘at least six green shipping corridors by the middle of the decade’.
Representatives of nation states at IMO’s MEPC, which meets next week, might be excused for asking ‘what the actual…’ just happened?! One can only hope the quick, clear thinking and decisive actions of the past few weeks trigger a new, more progressive mentality among MEPC delegates. And in particular those packed off with a mandate to stifle progression and protect oil and coal revenue and jobs.  Business and (some) governments have emerged as new agents of shipping’s climate change. They sent a signal that the ‘Blah Blah Blah’ has had its day and are not willing to hang around for the IMO."
CMA CGM and ENGIE work together on the next chapter of gas fuels,"November 10, 2021",https://splash247.com/cma-cgm-and-engie-work-together-on-the-next-chapter-of-gas-fuels/,"French liner CMA CGM, the most heavily invested shipping company in LNG propulsion in the world, is making plans to ensure its fleet remains on a green track, tying up with compatriot energy firm ENGIE to try and develop industrial-scale production and distribution of synthetic methane and bioLNG.
An initial project to produce liquefied biomethane (bioLNG) for shipping has already been launched by both groups at the Port of Marseille, in partnership with Métropole Aix-Marseille-Provence and TotalEnergies.
ENGIE is leading further synthetic methane production industrial projects in which CMA CGM will have the possibility to invest, including by means of multi-year purchase commitments. These projects will harness various technologies, such as pyro-gasification or methanation using green hydrogen and captured CO2.
CMA CGM currently has 20 so-called e-methane ready vessels equipped with dual-fuel engines and running on LNG and will have 44 such ships in its fleet buy the end of 2024.
Biomethane can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 67% compared to very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) on a well-to-wake basis, according to data from ENGIE, which also claims synthetic methane will eliminate the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions.
CMA CGM and ENGIE have also been working together for several months as part of the Coalition for the Energy of the Future launched in late 2019 at the Assises de l’Économie de la Mer conference by Rodolphe Saadé and supported by French President Emmanuel Macron."
Learning about advanced atomic,"October 27, 2021",https://splash247.com/learning-about-advanced-atomic/,"Mikal Bøe, CEO of CORE-POWER, douses many concerns people might have about nuclear power at sea.
Global shipping can only decarbonise if it can afford to and through decisive legislation by all coastal countries, and that’s a big challenge.
We must learn how to solve it, and that the answer will come from multiple solutions.
We’ve already learnt that emissions are warming the planet and causing real harm to humanity. We’ve learnt that combustion causes exhaust; zero carbon is not zero emissions and that net zero is not zero. We’re realising that true-zero emissions can only be achieved with energy systems that do not combust.
If we are to reduce 2008 emissions by 50%, then move to a complete true-zero energy system in the future, we must learn to look at the challenge from different angles so that we can see new solutions that are fit-for-purpose in different settings.
There are now 100,000 vessels on the water which are 100 GRT or larger. Of these, just 7,300 ships consume 47% of all marine fuels and cause almost 50% of all the air pollution from shipping. That’s not just an issue for ocean transportation, but for all the stakeholders who rely on our industry for the delivery of commodities, industrial components, and durable consumer goods. Shipping is perceived as the major polluter of global trade. That affects us all.
All the world’s 1,650 capes would produce enough waste over 25 years to fit into a single 40-foot container
Those 7,300 ships are the largest bulkers, tankers, container ships and cruise ships. This ‘sub-sector’ of shipping is the one that carries most of the cargo, only trades between a limited number of ports and is operated by the strongest and most resilient companies. It’s in effect, the industrial-carriage end of our market. If we can learn how to bring true-zero emission energy systems to these ships, we can solve the IMO2050 challenge, and afford to do so on our own terms.
Why? Because the only true-zero emission energy system that can take on the challenge of both true-zero emissions and affordability for the largest ships, is advanced atomic. Not conventional nuclear, or naval propulsion technologies which has been in use for decades and is not suitable for commercial shipping, but a new generation of machines like the Molten Salt Reactor which is designed to be fit-for-purpose in large ships.
MSRs are fit-for-purpose in large ships because they can provide power for life and do really well in marine accidents. They emit nothing at all, even if a ship sinks, and that make them immune to pollution taxes and carbon penalties. We learnt this week that CO2 taxes could cost up to $250 per ton, adding $750 to the cost of a ton of VLSFO.
Pressure is also growing from global brand-named shippers, as nine major companies including Amazon, Ikea and Unilever pledged to only move cargo on ships using zero-carbon fuel by 2040. Their goal is to pressure the shipping industry, through their ‘aggressive’ plan, to decarbonise faster.
The companies – which also includes Zara owner Inditex, Michelin, Patagonia, Brooks Running, Frog Bikes and Tchibo – said fuels used to hit the target must be scalable and have zero greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis including production. The companies’ initiative rules out using LNG as a fuel
MSRs are more powerful than current diesel engines, giving greater service speeds. They do not need refuelling, which takes away the need for fuel tanks or bunkering stops. If we accept this, we quickly learn that this means more cargo can be carried, faster for longer at a predictable and affordable price. We learn that it’s not just about cost anymore, it’s about cost and benefit.
To get there we need to learn a lot of new things. We’re good at that, and we like learning new things. Learning about advanced atomic and the MSR is exciting, and a real eye-opener. A large a growing cohort of shipping executives now learning about the MSR is testament to that.
Learning about waste
MSRs are remarkably fuel efficient, which is why they can power ships for so long. Learning why, is important. A capesize bulker running on MSR power would consume less than 200Kg of MSR-fuel in 25 years, leaving the same 200Kg as a final metallic waste to be stored in a dry cask the size of a briefcase for about 300 years. That’s equivalent of 1 gram of fuel per MW Day. Learning how that happens is exciting. All the world’s 1,650 capes would produce enough waste over 25 years to fit into a single 40-foot container or alternatively, we could use nuclear waste from conventional nuclear power stations as a fuel. That would change the waste debate completely, and it would be a lot cheaper than the cheapest bunkers. Lots to learn here.
The current cape fleet carries nearly all of the1.1 billion tons of seaborne iron ore every year. That fleet emits over 100 million tons of CO2 per year, amounting to 2.5 billion tons over the lifecycle of the fleet. Around 10% of that CO2 stays in the atmosphere for up to 120,000 years which means that 250 million tons of CO2 in smoke from the current capesize fleet will still be here with us in the year 122,021 continuously causing global warming.
That smoke is released into the air uncontrolled; it is toxic, carcinogenic, and harmful to the natural world. If we add the other 98,350 vessels on the water, you can see how our industry’s reputation as a major polluter is hard to argue against. End-of-life waste from advanced atomic can be mostly recycled, reused and re-purposed. We’ve been doing it for 80 years, we’re good at it and we know it doesn’t harm anyone, and it doesn’t pollute nature. It’s not common knowledge, but it’s worth learning about because nuclear waste is not what you think it is.
Learning about safety
Standards and safety regulations for atomic technologies are the most sophisticated standards in the world. Combining these with those for advanced atomic ships, means these new true-zero ships will be built to the highest new standards. They will be manned by specially trained personnel whose will enjoy jobs with status and good pay. They will be flagged in countries with mature atomic regulators, not under flags of convenience.
The UK is one such country and is taking the lead. The UK Government announced in August that it will pass SOLAS Chapter 8 (The ‘nuclear code’) into law in 2021, laying the path to a resurgent UK flag for large ships powered by advanced atomic technologies and for such ships to call in UK ports. These advanced atomic ships will be built to new class rules and operate with appropriate insurances. They could be jointly owned by the ships’ operators and the advanced atomic plant owners.
Increasingly, ports will want these ships, operated by responsible organisations for their true-zero emission environmental footprint and the benefit of having clean electric power provided from the ship to shore gear whilst on berth.
This month our industry is doing its best to get noticed by world leaders at COP26 in Glasgow, demanding predictable policies, supportive regulations, and carbon taxes.
What will happen? We will learn that politicians, regulators, and stakeholders are realising the answer to decarbonising is not limited to hydrogen and intermittent weather energies but includes powerful and fit-for-purpose advanced atomic technologies. The landscape will shift, and we will learn that a multitude of new solutions which we can afford, are possible."
Stopford on Maersk and methanol,"August 25, 2021",https://splash247.com/stopford-on-maersk-and-methanol/,"The world’s most famous shipping economist, Dr Martin Stopford, the non-executive president of Clarkson Research Services, writes for Splash today, reacting to the news from Copenhagen where Maersk has put down a $1.4bn bet on methanol powered boxships.
It is 15 years since the Emma Maersk was launched. With her 109,000 hp engine and 25.5 knot design speed, she was the beginning of the big gas guzzler generation. So it’s great that Maersk is now taking this initiative to build methanol powered ships, but how green are they? And is it really a revolution?
Let’s start with the green issue. How green is methanol? It’s a hydrocarbon fuel and when burnt in a marine diesel engine it produces almost as much CO2 as heavy fuel oil (VLSFO). LNG and LPG both perform better. What makes methanol different is that it is not extracted from the earth, it is manufactured. If the manufacturing process uses green energy such as biomass, wind or solar, the methanol produced is green. Otherwise, it is just another hydrocarbon producing big CO2 emissions.
The real revolution is Maersk’s aim to negotiate a zero carbon freight premium, which shares the cost of the $2,000 a tonne green fuel with shippers
By placing contracts for green methanol, Maersk is helping to stimulate production, which is great for the environment. But it is not straightforward. There is serious competition for the limited supply of green energy needed to make green methanol and the conversion process is inefficient (40-70% of the energy is lost). So making methanol for ships may not be the best way to use this scarce resource.
Green methanol is also expensive. Maersk says it could cost $1,000 a tonne, and it takes two tonnes of methanol to do the work of one tonne of HFO (19.7 MJ/kilogram compared with 41.8 MJ /kilogram for HFO) which pushes the ‘real’ price up to $2,000 a tonne, so shippers must expect to pay a lot more for ‘green transport’.
From a risk perspective, Maersk gets a lot of bang for their buck. Methanol burns easily in internal combustion engines and the new ships can switch between VLSFO and methanol. This is mature technology (I used to make model aircraft with tiny engines burning methanol). So, if the methanol doesn’t work out price-wise, the ships can switch to VLSFO and have not lost much.
Overall, Maersk should be congratulated for showing the world that shipping is serious about the environment, at a time when there’s not much green maritime technology on offer. But although it sounds revolutionary, it is just using established technology and a scarce supply of green energy to manufacture a hydrocarbon fuel that can be burnt in a ship. There are already about 20 ships in service or on the orderbook. And there are many small plants in operation or under development worldwide, producing green methanol.
The real revolution is not the fuel – there is still a long way to go on that front. It is their aim to negotiate a zero carbon freight premium which shares the cost of the $2,000 a tonne green fuel with shippers. The liner companies need the shippers as financial partners on the voyage to zero carbon in 2050 and this would get the show started.
As Rod Stewart put it “The first cut is the deepest” and who better to make it than Maersk?

CMA CGM leads Marseille’s bio-LNG pitch,"July 6, 2021",https://splash247.com/cma-cgm-leads-marseilles-bio-lng-pitch/,"Marseille-headquartered CMA CGM could get a reliable source of bio-LNG in its own backyard soon. The company that has invested more than any other carrier in LNG-fuelled newbuilds is now looking to help future-proof its investments, making fuel from local household waste.
EveRé, operator of a multi-process household waste treatment plant commissioned by Métropole Aix-Marseille-Provence has teamed with CMA CGM as well as Elengy, a subsidiary of Engie, operating liquefied natural gas terminals at Fos-sur-Mer and energy major TotalEnergies to study the feasibility of creating France’s first production unit for liquefied biomethane or bio-LNG.
Produced by converting the biodegradable part of household waste from the Marseille Provence region, the fuel would be made available to ports in the region.
“The project forms a circular economic system,” CMA CGM claimed in a release, adding: “Using the area’s household waste will help reduce local air pollutants (nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and fine particles), improving air quality and quality of life for people living in the region and supporting the energy transition in the shipping industry.”
Bio-LNG, combined with the dual-fuel gas engine technology developed by CMA CGM, reduces greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide by at least 67% relative to well-to-wake VLSFO, the French carrier claimed in a release. On the basis of a tank-to-wake measurement, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 88%, CMA CGM maintained.
“Bio-LNG has particular advantages when it is produced from domestic and agricultural waste. The process can capture methane that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere, resulting in a fuel that is not just zero GHG emissions but has the potential for negative emissions,” SEA-LNG, the lobby group promoting LNG as a marine fuel, suggested in a report from earlier in the year.
By the end of 2024, 44 of CMA CGM’s vessels will be powered by LNG."

Global CO2 levy as the green driver for shipping,"June 3, 2021",https://splash247.com/global-co2-levy-as-the-green-driver-for-shipping/,"Kare Press-Kristensen, a senior adviser at Green Transition Denmark, writes for Splash today on how market-based measures could decarbonise shipping within the next 17 years.
In Denmark, levies are the driver of green transition in many areas. A levy is the most cost-efficient way to stimulate green transition next to transferable quotas. The basic idea is to put a price on emissions (here calculated as CO2-equivalents) and thereby incentivize reduced emissions. The polluter decides if it is best to reduce emissions or pay the levy – and the polluter decides how to reduce emissions.
Levies work if they are significant enough to motivate changes e.g. energy savings and/or switch to zero carbon fuel. Furthermore, levies need to be transparent prospectively to stimulate investments in green transition e.g. production of zero carbon fuels and development of new engines etc. In addition, levies should be adjusted over time in parallel to technological development. Finally, levy revenues can reduce green transition costs by reimbursing the revenue as financial subsidies to zero carbon fuels.
Business case without a levy
Green ammonia/methanol will probably cost around 1,500 $ per ton fuel oil energy equivalent (FO-eq).The current price of VLSFO is around 500 $ per ton and HFO around 400 $ per ton (March 2021).Price gap: 1,000 $ for VLSFO per ton FO-eq and 1,100 $ for HFO per ton FO-eq.
Result: There is no financial driver for green shipping fuels due to the price gap and other sectors will buy green hydrogen, ammonia and methanol (chemical industry, aviation, trucks etc.) when produced.
A levy-reimbursement system can close the price gap
Introduce a basic levy of 60 $ per ton CO2-eq (GWP-20 well to wake) in 2025 (equals around 300 $ per ton VLSFO/HFO1) and subsequently increase the levy by 18 $ per ton CO2-eq per year reaching 150 $ in 2030 and 240 $ in 2035 (750 $ and 1,200 $ per ton VLSFO/HFO in 2030 and 2035, respectively). A similar levy should be introduced on natural gas, distillate fuels etc. The revenue should be reimbursed as support for fuel savings and green methanol/ammonia (table 1). This could result in decarbonisation of shipping towards 2040 (table 2 and figure 1) i.e. aligned with the Paris-agreement (1.5 °C goal).
Business case with a levy in 2030
Assuming green ammonia/methanol will cost 1,500 $ per ton FO-eq and that the price of VLSFO and HFO will drop to 100 $ per ton due to reduced demand. Levy cost for VLSFO/HFO: 750 $ per ton FO-eq. Reimbursement: 825 $ per ton FO-eq cf. table 1.
Result: Zero carbon fuels will be attractive since the price of VLSFO/HFO will be 850 $ (100 + 750) per ton and the reimbursement reduces the price of green ammonia/methanol to 675 $ (1,500 – 825) per ton FO-eq. Furthermore, huge fuel savings will be gained since many savings have reduction costs far below these fuel prices. Price increase for the end consumer will be negligible (around 1 %).
A similar principle should be used for natural gas, distillate fuels etc. providing same decarbonisation. Inreality the levy and reimbursement should, of course, be adjusted in relation to the actual developmentin the price of VLSFO/HFO and green methanol/ammonia as well as other key factors. Thereby thedecarbonisation curve of shipping would look different from figure 1 which should only be seen as apossibility based upon as quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to illustrate the key principle."
"325,000 dwt giant bulker gets the wind rotor treatment, Vale keen on further sail investments","May 14, 2021",https://splash247.com/325000-dwt-giant-bulker-gets-the-wind-rotor-treatment-vale-keen-on-further-sail-investments/,"The largest ship to date has had wind propulsion kit fixed to its deck. Pan Ocean’s 325,000 dwt 
			Sea Zhoushan very large ore carrier newbuild, due to go on charter to Brazilian miner Vale, is now sporting five white, 25 m high Norsepower rotor sails across its huge deck. The rotor sails can be tilted by using hydraulic cylinders. The solution is fully automated and detects whenever the wind is strong enough to deliver fuel and emission savings, at which point the sails start automatically.
The sails’ manufacturer, Norsepower, claims the new vessel will enjoy an efficiency gain of up to 8% and a consequent reduction of up to 3,400 tons of CO2 per year. By Splash estimates, the installed equipment will result in fuel savings of just over $500,000 a year based on today’s Rotterdam VLSFO prices. 
Further wind rotors are likely to be added on other ships on contract to the Brazilian miner. Rodrigo Bermelho, shipping technical manager at Vale, said that if the pilot with the Sea Zhoushan proves effective, at least 40% of Vale’s long term chartered fleet could be able to use the technology, which would result in a reduction of almost 1.5% of Vale’s annual iron ore maritime transport emissions.
Commenting on the installation, Tuomas Riski, CEO of Norsepower, said: “Installing our rotor sails on the first VLOC demonstrates that our technology is adaptable across varied operational profiles and vessel types. As vessel operators and charterers strive to decarbonise, the value of wind propulsion for both a retrofit and newbuild vessels is undeniable.”"
CMA CGM signs up for 22 boxships at CSSC,"May 3, 2021",https://splash247.com/cma-cgm-signs-up-for-22-boxships-at-cssc/,"French containerline CMA CGM has placed an order for 22 containerships at China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).

Could wind propulsion fund the full decarbonisation of shipping?,"March 15, 2021",https://splash247.com/could-wind-propulsion-fund-the-full-decarbonisation-of-shipping/,"Gavin Allwright, secretary at the International Windship Association, has seen a lot of speculation and discussion around the costs and time lag for the roll out of decarbonisation for commercial shipping. The below, he concedes, is a no doubt flawed but honest attempt to show how the rapid scaling of wind propulsion across the fleet in the next 10 years would effectively not only pay for itself, but could go a very long way to releasing the funds required to go beyond IMO 2050 and even deliver full decarbonisation for the fleet.
I am going to make a bold assertion (as a non-financial expert) that this is not just possible but in fact likely. By installing substantial wind propulsion systems across the 60,000 large vessel fleet this decade and subsequent replacement vessels using wind propulsion systems as standard, the reduction in fuel use prior to 2050 would be equal to the amount being forecast that is required to not just meet the IMO2050 target of 50% reduction, but potentially cover the entire decarbonisation ticket price.
Now, as you follow me down this particular rabbit hole, you will have to allow me to make a series of assumptions, but I think you will agree that these are overall conservative. What follows is my back of the envelope calculation, and for this purpose it is stripped of IRR, interest/currency rate variations and other investment caveats.
For the purpose of this simple calculation, I will assume that we will have a static fleet size of 60,000 ships and one that is currently burning through 300 million tons of fuel per year (1bn tons of C02 emissions). Adopting a base line of today’s price of VLSFO in Rotterdam, which stands at $500 a ton, that translates into a total bunker spend of roughly $150bn per year.
For the sake of this calculation, we will assume a 35% increase in fuel price over each decade starting in the 2030s, which is made up of inflation, the introduction of more expensive alternative fuels into the energy mix and carbon taxes being imposed within the next 10 years.
A study conducted by University Maritime Advisory Services (UMAS) and the Energy Transitions Commission (ETC), found that reducing the industry’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2050 will require approximately $1trn. According to the study, the annual average investment needed would be $40bn to $60bn over the next two decades, and to fully decarbonise the global shipping industry by 2050, an additional $400bn of investment would be needed over 20 years, bringing the total to $1.4trn to $1.9trn. The study also states that 87% of that investment would be required on land and was primarily focused on alternative, low carbon fuels.
Nonetheless at $1.4trn, by my calculation this equates to just over $23m per ship in operation today.
A final base assumption is for the energy delivery from the full rollout of wind propulsion across the fleet, and I set that at 20%. This number includes retrofits, optimised newbuilds and also benefits derived from some limited operational changes from speed or power limitation, weather routing for wind, etc.
To achieve that I have averaged out the cost of installation to $5m per ship (of course, far less for small vessels, more substantial investments for larger vessels) and factors in the expected decrease in costs of these systems as these are mass produced for fleet deployments, this total is thus estimated to be $300bn.
A lot of assumptions made, and I am sure some of these will be challenged, however now for the fairly straightforward calculation part.
2020s – the decade of rapid installation – the savings will be limited as many vessels are being installed and not operational throughout the decade, but if savings came in at 5% of the total $1.5trn bill, this would save $75bn over these initial years. This is calculated without any fuel price increase from now until 2030.
2030s – retrofit installations are complete and many replacement vessels are enhanced/optimised wind or even primary wind. Fuel price rises 35% to a decade average of $675 a ton thus a total spend of just over $200bn a year, reduced by 20% derived from wind, leaving $160bn a year. Thus wind saves the industry $405bn in the 2030s.
2040s – fuel prices increase again by 35% to a decade average of $910 a ton. The total spend without wind would be $2.73trn but wind reduces that to roughly $2.2trn for the decade, saving $546bn.
Thus by 2050, the incorporation of fleet-wide wind propulsion, with an initial price tag of $300bn would unlock roughly $1trn in fuel savings along with reducing the need to deliver such a large amount of alternative zero-emissions fuel to boot, so potentially shaving 10% to 20% from that headline cost too.
The conclusion, rapid deployment of wind propulsion this decade along with the replacement of vessels with enhanced wind vessels in the coming decades would release the resources available to shipping to invest in the transition to full decarbonisation.
As a final note, we need to remember that wind propulsion is the gift that keeps giving as all of these wind propulsion systems will continue to deliver savings throughout the lifetime of the vessels, and while the price of alternative fuels will likely eventually fall, the use of an abundant energy source, delivered to the vessel at the point of use with no need for infrastructure, onboard storage all at a fixed zero cost, that will be very unlikely to lose its economic draw."
Baltic Exchange adds new LNG-powered seaborne gas assessments,"March 4, 2021",https://splash247.com/baltic-exchange-adds-new-lng-powered-seaborne-gas-assessments/,"A new set of independent indices for the liquified natural gas (LNG) seaborne trade went live this week, based on the carriers burning LNG, rather than marine fuel oil or marine gas oil, as their primary fuel.
Published twice weekly, the new indices have been given the acronym (BLNGg) and will be published alongside the current LNG indices which are based on LNG carriers burning very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). Historical data for the new indices will be available dating back to 1 January 2020.
“The introduction of contracts based on the usage of LNG as bunker fuel among global shipping routes is the next step in the evolution of freight and provides another market-based solution to help our customers to manage their global gas risk,” a release from the Baltic stated.
Since the introduction of the 2020 global sulphur cap by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the majority of LNG carriers have switched to LNG boil-off gas rather than burn low-sulphur fuel oil, marine gas oil or install emissions abatement technology. The boil-off process allows the naturally evaporating LNG cargo to be sent to the engine room and burned by the main boilers as fuel."
Bio-LNG makes its pitch on shipping’s path to 2050,"February 26, 2021",https://splash247.com/bio-lng-makes-its-pitch-on-shippings-path-to-2050/,"New analysis from SEA-LNG, the lobby group promoting LNG as a marine fuel, claims that for every 10% of bio-LNG dropped in and blended with LNG as a marine fuel, a vessel can achieve two extra years’ compliance with the annual efficiency ratio (AER) curve used to secure preferable funding under the Poseidon Principles. This extends the average seven-year additional competitive advantage for Poseidon Principle loans achieved with LNG alone, SEA-LNG claimed in a release yesterday. The analysis comes at a time where LNG as a future fuel is coming under pressure with significant announcements from Maersk on methanol and MISC on ammonia in recent days.
The analysis is based on a capesize vessel, considering the main engine only with no auxiliaries to provide a conservative estimate.
The analysis compares LNG plus bio-LNG from a zero-carbon, sustainable source with conventional vessel fuels such as HFO, VLSFO and MGO. Bio-LNG is fully compatible with existing LNG infrastructure and technologies and can be dropped in and blended with LNG.

The use of bio-LNG as a drop-in fuel may extend the compliance runway further
LNG fuel delivers greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions of up to 21% well-to-wake and up to 28% tank-to-wake, SEA-LNG data suggests, despite growing concerns about the methane slip from many LNG-powered vessels. The GHG data means that LNG-powered vessels perform well according to Poseidon Principles’ funding criteria, which were instigated by financial institutions to move shipping towards the International Maritime Organization’s 2050 decarbonisation goals.
The Poseidon Principles measure progress towards these objectives using an AER scoring.
John Hatley, SEA-LNG investment committee chairman, commented: “As banks increasingly align with green finance principles, LNG offers benefits for emissions reduction and provides an extended compliance runway for Poseidon Principle sustainability linked loans. An investor preserves more favourable financing terms compared to conventional marine fuels such as HSFO, VLSFO, and MGO. The use of bio-LNG as a drop-in fuel may extend this runway even further- an additional two years for every 10% dropped-in. This means lower ship emissions now and a compliance extension that yields long term competitive advantage.”
The recent CE Delft study concludes that bio-LNG is a scalable solution for the maritime sector. Estimated sustainable global supplies potentially exceed the future energy demand of the global shipping fleet. It also showed that bio-LNG will likely be commercially competitive relative to other low- and zero-carbon fuels.
This analysis is supported by a recent report by the IEA on the outlook for biogas and biomethane. The IEA report concludes that feedstocks available for sustainable production of biogas and biomethane are huge, but only a fraction of this potential is used today. For biomethane to realise its potential as a major zero-emissions energy carrier, policies should remove barriers to scaling and create a single, cross-border market for biomethane and bio-LNG.
“Bio-LNG has particular advantages when it is produced from domestic and agricultural waste. The process can capture methane that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere, resulting in a fuel that is not just zero GHG emissions but has the potential for negative emissions,” SEA-LNG pointed out yesterday.
Peter Keller, chairman of SEA-LNG, added, “As GHG emissions are cumulative, the decarbonisation challenge only gets tougher the later we take steps to address it. Waiting for options is not an option. The industry must act now using LNG and bio-LNG that we know provide benefits today and into the future. With the introduction of bio and synthetic variants, LNG not only provides a pathway to decarbonisation in its own right, but also provides the physical infrastructure and asset base that can be used by other alternative fuels, when and if they become commercially viable.”
CMA CGM is the carrier with the biggest investments in LNG-powered tonnage to date. It is now actively investigating bio-LNG possibilities in a bid to futureproof its gas investments. CMA CGM is a founding member of the the Coalition for the Energy of the Future. Launched in France two years ago, other members include Airbus, Carrefour, ENGIE, Total and Wärtsilä. The coalition revealed this week it is working on developing carbon neutral liquefied natural gas.

Maersk will operate the world’s first carbon neutral containership by 2023 in big methanol breakthrough,"February 17, 2021",https://splash247.com/maersk-will-operate-the-worlds-first-carbon-neutral-containership-by-2023-in-big-methanol-breakthrough/,"Maersk today officially fast-tracked its decarbonisation plans, with a methanol-fuelled 2,000 teu feeder vessel set to be ordered this year to begin operating in 2023. The world’s largest container line also said today that all future Maersk owned newbuildings will have dual fuel technology installed.
“A.P. Moller – Maersk’s ambition is to lead the way in decarbonising global logistics. Our customers expect us to help them decarbonise their global supply chains, and we are embracing the challenge, working on solving the practical, technical and safety challenges inherent in the carbon neutral fuels we need in the future. Our ambition to have a carbon neutral fleet by 2050 was a moonshot when we announced in 2018. Today we see it as a challenging, yet achievable target to reach,” said Søren Skou, CEO of A.P. Moller – Maersk.
Around half of Maersk’s 200 largest customers have set – or are in the process of setting – ambitious science-based or zero carbon targets for their supply chains, and the figure is on the rise.
Maersk’s methanol feeder vessel will be deployed in one of its intra-regional networks, likely Europe. While the vessel will be able to operate on standard VLSFO, the plan is to operate the vessel on carbon neutral e-methanol or sustainable bio-methanol from day one.

It will be a significant challenge to source an adequate supply of carbon neutral methanol within our timeline to pioneer this technology
“It will be a significant challenge to source an adequate supply of carbon neutral methanol within our timeline to pioneer this technology. Our success relies on customers embracing this groundbreaking product and strengthened collaboration with fuel manufacturers, technology partners and developers to ramp up production fast enough. We believe our aspiration to put the world’s first carbon neutral liner vessel in operation by 2023 is the best way to kick start the rapid scaling of carbon neutral fuels we will need,” said Henriette Hallberg Thygesen, CEO of fleet and strategic brands, A.P. Moller – Maersk.
Both the methanol-fueled feeder vessel and the decision to install dual fuel engines on future newbuildings are part of Maersk’s ongoing fleet replacement.
Details of exactly where and when the groundbreaking ship will be built have yet to be made public. A spokesperson for Maersk told Splash today: “The concept design is finalised and we are currently in discussions with equipment suppliers and yards. It is crucial to find the right partners who are ready to engage development resources into such a step change of the industry.”
Maersk reiterated today that it sees methanol, alcohol-lignin blends and ammonia as shipping’s primary fuel candidates for the future.
Some of the biggest names across the Danish transport spectrum including Maersk joined forces last year to produce renewable methanol. Maersk, Copenhagen Airports, DSV Panalpina, roro operator DFDS, airline SAS and utility firm Ørsted have partnered to develop an industrial-scale production facility to produce sustainable fuels including renewable methanol for Maersk vessels. The renewable methanol pathway identified by Maersk is promising, the carrier stated in a release in 2019, because it is liquid at normal temperature and there are existing markets, known execution and infrastructure which can be extended. It is also not a highly toxic product.
The Methanol Institute, which advocates for the adoption of methanol as a fuel in marine and other transport modes, welcomed today’s feeder ship breakthrough news.
Chris Chatterton, COO of the Methanol Institute, said: “Maersk is once again showing industry leadership in adopting renewable methanol as a key plank in its strategy towards carbon neutrality.”
We need industry leaders like Maersk to share research and learnings
Speaking in a January episode of the Outrage and Optimism podcast, which focused on the future of shipping, Skou first revealed Maersk’s plans to order carbon neutral ships within the next three years, starting off with smaller tonnage ships aimed at regional trades, before taking the knowledge and experience from this landmark first generation of new ships to order a round of larger boxships.

Maersk has eschewed new orders lately and has avoided going down the LNG-fuelled path of many of its rivals.
In December 2018, Maersk came out as the first major shipping line to pledge to be carbon neutral by 2050.
In July 2020, A.P. Moller – Maersk together with other large companies such as Nike, Microsoft, Starbucks, Danone and Mercedez-Benz entered the climate coalition Transform to Net Zero, which aims to deliver guidance and business plans to enable a transformation to net zero emissions, as well as research, advocacy, and best practices to make it easier for the private sector to not only set ambitious goals—but also deliver meaningful emissions reductions and economic success
Earlier this month the coalition put out a position paper for priorities for this year and in the decades to come.
The paper noted that members would work in 2021 to pilot the end-to-end decarbonisation of value chains, developing a roadmap for company action to achieve a “just and inclusive” net zero transformation.
“The industry has come together to work on the decarbonisation issue, which requires collaboration across the value chain – from the fuel suppliers to the classification societies to the ports and shipowners,” Andrew Stephens, the executive director of the Sustainable Shipping Initiative, told Splash last month.
“First movers are an essential part of this chain, investing into R&D for sustainable zero carbon fuels and setting their ambitions above what is expected and leading the way. We need industry leaders like Maersk to share research and learnings to enable and accelerate the industry’s transition to zero emissions,” Stephens said.
Today is a pretty amazing day for the team here. We have accelerated our net zero strategy and committed to ONLY order carbon neutral ready ships from now, starting with a methanol vessel in 2023. So proud of the @maersk team!!! #ThisIsNotAMoonShot #Leadership https://t.co/ypMTcwTtSL

Fuel price spread at world’s top bunkering hubs now firmly in triple-digit territory,"February 8, 2021",https://splash247.com/fuel-price-spread-at-worlds-top-bunkering-hubs-now-firmly-in-triple-digit-territory/,"The price spread between low (VLSFO) and high (HSFO) sulphur fuel oil continues to widen across the world.
Lorentzen & Stemoco noted in an update to clients today that the spread – often called the Hi5 – is now above $100 per ton in all the major bunkering hubs for the first time since before coronavirus was labelled a pandemic 11 months ago.
“In Fujairah, where the spread is the highest at $128 per ton, that spread can go into savings for a scrubber-fitted VLCC running on HSFO so that some $7,500 a day less is spent on bunkers on a laden voyage, assuming consumption of 60 tons a day,” the broker observed.
Braemar ACM’s tanker analysts pointed out in a market update that with the recent rise in bunker prices, the price differentials are beginning to make eco and scrubber vessels look more attractive for term business.
Prior to the onset of the global sulphur cap at the start of 2020, a price gap of $150 was deemed as the absolute outlier in terms of owners making a swift return on investment for their scrubber outlays.
"
Fuel price spread back in the spotlight,"January 29, 2021",https://splash247.com/fuel-price-spread-back-in-the-spotlight/,"With the fuel price spread between low and high sulphur fuel oil now firmly back in triple digit territory in Singapore, the world’s top bunkering hub, for most of this month, shipping lines – and scrubber manufacturers – are looking ahead to assess whether the gap will widen or stay at levels reached in January.
Since early November, the spread has widened steadily so that it now stands at $92 per tonne in Rotterdam and $112.5 per tonne in Singapore.
“Current marine fuel futures prices imply that this spread should remain relatively close to today’s levels over the next two years at both hubs,” Alphatanker stated in its most recent weekly report.
Peter Sand, chief shipping economist at BIMCO, predicted earlier that the price spread between shipping’s top two fuels would stick at around $100 per tonne within a band of $20 per tonne.

Current marine fuel futures prices imply that this spread should remain relatively close to today’s levels over the next two years
The price gap globally today stands at $75, according to the latest data from Ship & Bunker.
Alphatanker pointed out this week that an important driver widening spreads has been a low sulphur tighter middle distillate market of late. These have tightened amid seasonal heating demand with certain major markets such as the US Northeast, North Asia and central Europe still having a significant portion of their residential space heating demand accounted for by either heating oil (US and Europe) or kerosene (North Asia). In turn, higher middle distillate prices have fed into stronger VLSFO prices since low sulphur middle distillates are blended into many, although not all, VLSO grades.
“All told, while we consider that spreads reaching $150/mt is possible this year, we consider that a spread of $200/mt is highly unlikely unless crude prices were to move closer to $70/bbl,” Alphatanker predicted.
Bunker market analysts MABUX said this week the forecast price for Brent in 2021 is projected to be $60 to $65 per barrel, meaning the ship fuel price gap will grow moderately this year, reaching $120 to $130 in the medium outlook.
Alphatanker said the outlook for scrubber economics is now far brighter than four months ago. However, these economics remain far below which many shipowners were looking to when deciding whether to retrofit scrubbers on their ships.
Prior to the onset of the global sulphur cap at the start of 2020, a price gap of $150 was deemed as the absolute outlier in terms of owners making a swift return on investment for their scrubber outlays.
Alphatanker calculations suggest that a scrubber retrofitted to a tanker leaving drydock today would take three to four years to pay off, depending on tanker type plus the number of days at sea, compared with pre-IMO 2020 expectations that such an investment would be paid off within two years.
Statistics from DNV GL show that 7.5% of the commercial fleet has either ordered or already installed a scrubber."
LNG as a fuel through to 2050,"January 13, 2021",https://splash247.com/lng-as-a-fuel-through-to-2050/,"Peter Keller, SEA-LNG chairman, writes for Splash today
2020 was a year of tough choices for everyone in shipping. But one of the most important – the fuel choice that will get us to the IMO’s 2050 decarbonisation goals – just got a lot simpler. While existing fleets will have no choice to make significant efficiency and performance improvements, deepsea vessel owners considering a newbuild have a clear choice. They can start using LNG now, which is proven, delivers immediate GHG emission reductions, and is globally available with a fast-growing bunkering network. Alternatively, they can spend the next decade or more continuing to play for time and run the risk of replacing a vessel’s engine at a significant cost later or losing use of their asset value. In the meantime, they will not be contributing to the environmental improvements that are so badly needed but in fact exacerbating the problem.
Perfect zero-carbon fuel or unicorn?
We know that once emitted, GHGs cannot be easily removed from the atmosphere and will create further warming. Why wait for the perfect fuel – if such a thing exists – when we can start reducing GHGs now by using LNG, and at the same time enjoy the air quality benefits it delivers over other fuels.
It is perhaps counter intuitive to suggest that a fossil fuel like LNG provides a pathway to zero carbon. However, the reality is that it can and we cannot wait for a zero-carbon fuel. Our global economy dictates that ships must keep working.
Long term, various alternative fuels may become plausible and research is warranted. Today, however, we need to pick the fuel that is going to provide benefits now and move us in a positive direction for tomorrow. We must make this decision on a well-to-wake basis, so we can gauge the real consequences. Alternative fuels such as ammonia and hydrogen may emit no GHG when used in propulsion systems, such as internal combustion engines or fuel cells, but their overall, well-to-wake emissions depend on how they are produced. Only if they are produced from renewable energy such as wind and solar can they truly be ‘zero-emissions’ fuels. However, if they are produced from fossil fuels, as is the case now and for the foreseeable future, then their well-to-wake emissions can be far higher than those from fuels such as LNG. As yet, comprehensive analysis of alternatives has not been undertaken. We need this detailed data-based analysis if we are going to be able to truly assess the options on a level playing field and avoid unintended consequences.
LNG’s pathway to zero is significantly shorter and less risky than others. It requires a fraction of the R&D required by alternatives. Moreover, we are already seeing bio-LNG effectively being used as a drop-in fuel. The bio-LNG being sold today is sourced sustainably from waste and agricultural residues and does not compete with food crops or result in deforestation.
While bio-LNG production is not yet at a scale where it can power the deep-sea fleet, it is accelerating quickly on a global basis and is closer to being scalable than any other option. The 2020 CE Delft study clearly and factually confirms this important assumption. Synthetic LNG is also under development, but unlikely to be available at scale for at least a decade.
The clear advantage of LNG is that we can have our cake and eat it today. We can reduce emissions now, gradually increase those benefits by using bio-LNG, and then eventually take advantage of synthetic LNG when it does eventually scale. The aggressive IMO goals are in reach with LNG and the bio-LNG pathway. We are already seeing forward thinking operators like CMA-CGM introducing bio LNG into their fuel mix.
Poseidon Principles-compliant finance
As banks increasingly align with green finance principles, LNG offers potential financing benefits for newbuilds. For example, it provides an ‘extended compliance runway’ under the Poseidon Principles. An investor can gain up to eight years of more favourable financing terms compared with vessels fuelled by conventional marine fuels such as HSFO, VLSFO, and MGO. The use of bio-LNG as a drop-in fuel can extend this even further. That means you can start reducing your emissions now and enjoy the benefits of Poseidon Principles-compliant finance for the longer term.
As bio-LNG products become more readily available on a global basis, further reductions in carbon will be the result and IMO targets will be met. LNG and bio-LNG products have the important added advantage of essentially eliminating SOx, dramatically reducing NOx, as well as eliminating black carbon and particulate emissions. These important global health benefits cannot and should not be overlooked.
Existing infrastructure
The LNG infrastructure already exists and is available to support bio or synthetic LNG. This infrastructure is growing almost daily and has a proven safety record over decades of use. LNG cannot pollute our waterways, it is non-toxic, and ports around the world are facilitating the development of LNG bunkering facilities. Alternatives such as ammonia and hydrogen will require entirely new and costly supply chains for fuel production, transportation, and vessel bunkering. Further, will the seafaring and port communities accept the significant safety risks posed by the use of these fuels at scale? And the question of who will pay for these reportedly trillion-dollar infrastructure investments is an open but critical question.
No fuel is perfect, and there are always obstacles to overcome. Methane slip onboard vessels and within the fuel supply chain does happen. New engine technologies that dramatically reduce this risk are emerging quickly. It is a temporary problem with a technical fix, not a fundamental issue with the fuel. Upstream developments to deal with methane emissions in LNG supply chains are also advancing at pace. Other alternative fuels, like ammonia, have issues with slip in the engine combustion cycle that needs to be addressed given the toxicity of the product. Similarly, there are very practical problems to overcome with the super-cryogenic storage onboard vessels of hydrogen. These matters are being overlooked in the current discussions but need to be addressed with urgency.
Conventional marine fuels also benefit from existing infrastructure. It might be tempting for some to continue a business-as-usual pathway for their newbuild vessel investments based on HFO and Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS). However, the clock is ticking for EGCS’s and neither they nor the use of VLSFO does anything to mitigate GHG’s.
Futureproofing with dual fuel engines
Engine manufacturers are designing and building LNG dual-fuel engines that are or will be capable of using many of the future fuels being discussed, including bio and synthetic LNG. This protects the capital investments made by vessel owners today and reduces future fuel risks, regardless of whether technologies change or not.
For vessel owners looking to invest in new tonnage today, the choice is clear. You can start to reduce emissions now while protecting the future. Waiting for a zero-carbon alternative might seem attractive but the future is still a long way off and the technology required is not proven. Waiting is not an option as it both exacerbates the growing GHG emissions issues and does not provide the essential air quality benefits derived from LNG. The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and the sooner we start the journey the better. Waiting is not an option.

Aon launches industry-first fuel price insurance,"January 12, 2021",https://splash247.com/aon-launches-industry-first-fuel-price-insurance/,"Aon has launched a new fuel insurance solution, designed to help companies – including shipping lines – protect against rising fuel costs.
Backed by AAA-rated credit insurance, the coverage will be activated if the cost of fuel rises and exceeds an agreed limit providing shipowners with an alternative to bunker hedging. The policy will cover the difference between the agreed price and the higher price, paid out monthly, to help companies manage their fuel cost exposure and avoid significant spikes in market price.
Chris Bhatt, global head of sales, marine, Aon, said: “Aon is committed to identifying, understanding and developing innovative solutions to meet our clients’ evolving needs. With the launch of this solution, we are pleased to support our clients as they navigate an increasingly complex commercial environment and address long-tail risks to promote corporate resiliency and sustainability.”
Bunker fuel prices have been creeping up in recent weeks. Analysis published on Sunday from Copenhagen’s Sea-Intelligence shows for VLSFO fuel, the price has increased 35% from November 1, 2020 to January 8, 2021."
Fuel price spread heads towards triple-digit territory,"December 17, 2020",https://splash247.com/fuel-price-spread-heads-towards-triple-digit-territory/,"Emblematic of the topsy-turvy year shipping has endured, the Hi5, the spread between high and low sulphur fuel oil is closing out 2020 heading into triple-digit territory.
This time last year – before the world was plunged into a pandemic – the January 1 global sulphur cap introduction and its subsequent effects on the two main bunker fuels was expected to be one of the main talking points for shipping throughout 2020. In the end, the legislation came into force, the new low sulphur fuel was bought and used with little problem and the price differential with high sulphur fuel oil – the so-called Hi5 – collapsed within the opening weeks of the year, even before coronavirus was declared a global pandemic in March.

The spread has already crossed $100 per ton at Houston and other bunker hubs seem on track to follow
From an all-time high of $343 per ton in the first week of the year, the Hi5 has sat stubbornly in the $50 to $65 range for most of 2020. However, over the past five weeks the price differential has consistently risen (see chart below) to nudge towards the $80 mark among the world’s top 20 largest bunkering hubs.
In Houston, the largest bunkering hub in the Americas, the $100 mark has already been broken with Fujairah, the Middle East’s top spot for marine fuel, not far behind. The price differential in Singapore and Rotterdam stood at $73.50 and $81.25 respectively today.
“The spread has already crossed $100 per ton at Houston, where the tendency is strongest, and the other bunker hubs seem on track to follow,” commented Christian Plum, co-founder of BunkerMetric, a Denmark-based digital technology firm. BunkerMetric has detected that low sulphur fuel oil prices lately are correlating more closely to Gasoil prices rather than heavy sulphur fuel oil.
BIMCO’s chief shipping analyst, Peter Sand, told Splash today that the next level of “oil market normalisation” began in early November as news about the vaccines coming soon broke. This lifted crude oil prices and bunker prices too.
BIMCO is predicting the $100 price differential mark could be broken in Singapore, the world’s top bunkering hub, as early as next month. The shipping organisation believes the post-Covid-19 normalised spread will likely stick at around $100 within a band of $20 per ton.
Ahead of the sulphur cap coming into force a price differential of $150 per ton was seen as the absolute outlier in terms of timely payback times for those who had invested in scrubbers. Given the low Hi-5 numbers seen throughout 2020, analysts contacted by Splash suggest this number has crept up to $200 for 2021 and 2022.
“The widening of the spread has been driven by three factors: continued economic recovery in Asia, which has increased demand for light products that compete against VLSFO in the refinery process, current subdued demand for HSFO, and an increase in outright prices overall, which tends to widen spreads,” commented Mark Waddington from Channoil Consulting.
On the bunker futures markets, Chris Hudson, a director at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in London, said the spread difference for the front month future has recovered from around $57 at the end of October to over $80 currently, and on the Cal 21 period from $70 to $94. 
“The main driving forces behind this shift is a return to some normality on 0.5% demand, with shipping operations recovering somewhat from the global lockdowns, as well as the dwindling strength of pricings on the old HSFO,” Hudson explained.
Latest data from Clarksons Research shows scrubbers have been installed on 4.1% of all ships trading today and are pencilled in for 12.4% of all vessels contracted at shipyards.

The consensus for an effective carbon price for shipping,"December 16, 2020",https://splash247.com/the-consensus-for-an-effective-carbon-price-for-shipping/,"Channoil Consulting in collaboration with Gibson Shipbrokers have produced a paper offering views and analysis of the route to 2050, crunching the numbers of fuel prices.
The world is under increasing pressure to decarbonise. Historically, the shipping sector has been somewhat exempt from external pressure to improve emissions, but this is changing fast. We have investigated the context of decarbonisation in the maritime sector, take a reality check on the fuelling options and likely short-term solutions, and examine fuel economics for the likely short-term options.
The fuels that are readily available for the maritime sector today are the conventional fuels of VLSFO, or HFO using abatement scrubbing systems, Marine Gasoil, bio-derived fuels using FAME or HVO, and lastly LNG.
We have focussed our assessment on the near term. Prices for most fossil fuels are currently depressed due to lack of demand: VLSFO and Marine Gasoil are at historically low multiples against Brent crude oil. LNG is oversupplied and priced accordingly. The biofuel grades price higher due to the high costs of production, these costs being supported by demand driven by various mandates on their use.
Using current prices for these grades and the appropriate fuel consumption, based on fuel energy content, allows us to draw a comparison between the various fuel grades as shown below.
As of today, there is no carbon levy on the maritime sector. And in today’s price environment, LNG is a hands-down winner. It gives a saving of around $7,700 per day versus VLSFO, based on a VLCC’s typical daily consumption, so this could amount to a total saving on fuel of $2,800,000 per year.
A VLCC making a fuel saving of $5,000/day could very well be able to justify the additional $14m investment and generate an IRR of 10% over a 15-year period.
Unsurprisingly, HVO and FAME are completely uncompetitive against other grades in the absence of a carbon trading scheme.
Using an indicative current value of the EU ETS CO2 price of €30, there is little change to this picture. Indeed, LNG benefits from its lower GHG intensity, but HVO and FAME continue to be outcompeted both by LNG and by conventional fossil fuels.
It is also worth noting that the trends for both the carbon costs and VLSFO/MGO prices are to increase, the former as and when the price of crude oil recovers, the latter as decarbonisation agendas build momentum, whilst the trend for the relative LNG price is to stay low, as there is oversupply for the next 10 years. So, the fuel cost benefit for dual LNG fuel ships could increase further.
Trafigura has recently proposed an industry levy of $250-$300 per tonne of CO2 emitted, on high GHG fuels as a means of accelerating the decarbonisation transition in Marine. This is the level required to make the biodiesel HVO and FAME grades competitive against fossil fuels, as shown below:
But the high carbon price, while bringing HVO and FAME more on a par with fossil fuels, would also provide a huge incentive to LNG.
We have focussed our analysis of current fuel alternatives. When considering lower carbon options, the likes of blue or green ammonia, hydrogen or methanol are simply not a realistic option at present. This then leaves LNG and biodiesels as alternatives to fossil fuels.
Even without a carbon scheme, LNG looks very attractive and we would expect the current trend towards investment in LNG bunkering infrastructure to continue. The daily benefits are likely to support dual fuel vessel investment plans.
As and when the maritime sector is brought into the EU ETS, it would take a huge increase in the current carbon price for ship owners to deviate from their current fuel mix. A higher carbon levy could provide an attractive additional boost for LNG.
However, the ETS covers many consumption sectors, including heavy industry and commerce, all of which can be served by green energy options that require a lower carbon price than that needed to make HVO or FAME compete against fossil fuels.
The consensus for an effective carbon price for the maritime sector appears to fall somewhere in the $100 to $150 per tonne CO2e range. We think it unlikely that a carbon price in the EU ETS would move high enough to support the introduction of HVO or FAME at any significant level for Marine use. This sector would require its own separate approach, as advocated by Trafigura. What this analysis further shows us clearly, is that HVO and FAME are among the most expensive green fuels, which should in the long term restrict their use to sectors where there is no feasible alternative. Shipping is not one of these sectors in the long run.
Finally, investors in an LNG bunkering facility or a dual fuel vessel are likely to be considering a 20-year time horizon. An important consideration will be how these assets can be recycled for use with future fuels such as ammonia and hydrogen once they become available at scale and at a cost-effective price."
BunkerMetric: Savings from transparency,"December 14, 2020",https://splash247.com/bunkermetric-savings-from-transparency/,"As the shipping industry is making efforts to meet the IMO’s 2050 decarbonisation targets, shipowners and shipmanagers have to navigate various solutions for energy transition, from electric batteries for shoreline activity to a variety of fuels like LNG, methanol, LPG, and ethane as well as alternative fuels like ammonia, synthetic methane, and green hydrogen. 
BunkerMetric, a Denmark-based digital technology firm, is working to assist operators and bunker buyers in finding the best bunker purchasing plan with its BunkerPlanner analytical tool.
Before setting up BunkerMetric, co-founder Christian Plum saw that the bunkering industry was underserved with analytical tools which could create transparency, lower costs and assist planners and buyers to make good decisions faster.
“The industry is always hungry for good cost savings, which is a good door-opener, but what we believe can help our tools stick with customers is how we can address some of the real pain points. How can I quickly adapt to changed market conditions? How can I reduce the risk of bad business practices and personal bias by adding more transparency to bunker purchasing and the supply chain? How can I make shipping greener and lower fuel costs by calculating the voyage execution?” Plum says.
BunkerMetric’s tools now focus on the existing fuel supply chains currently covering VLSFO, MGO and HFO, adding new fuel types such as LNG as their availability and market develops.
“We are keenly watching how this green fuel transition discussion is evolving and are preparing to support this in our operational tools,” Plum says.
Plum reckons in the longer run new carbon neutral fuels and engines will develop and become dominant, but currently the world’s fleet is geared towards carbon-based products and this fleet will only be slowly replaced over the next 30 years. Meanwhile, public opinion and more and more governments expect and will eventually demand a transition to greener fuels soon.
“Ultimately we will need to turn the current fleet of ships into green ships. It will be too costly to completely replace engines and storage tanks for new fuel types, so there is a need, at least transitionally, for fuels which are both green and, perhaps with minor modifications, can be carried and burned with storage tanks and engines predominant now,” Plum says, adding that it could be bio-fuels or power-to-liquid fuels with the right properties that can be transported with current bunker industry infrastructure and burned in currently used engines.
BunkerPlanner interfaces with data from relevant systems and also includes all auxiliary costs for a bunkering as port call costs, barge cost, deviation cost, opportunity / TC costs to calculate the overall cheapest port; and forecast the bunker consumption to decide on the right volume.
“By including all relevant costs, and calculating these against each other to find the best options, it gives transparency that you are buying the right amount, in the right place,” Plum claims."
Standards being developed for methanol-powered tankers,"December 10, 2020",https://splash247.com/standards-being-developed-for-methanol-powered-tankers/,"A coalition of Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, MAN Energy Solutions and the Methanol Institute have commenced a project that will enable product tanker charterers and shipowners to utilise methanol as fuel.
The parties will work together to develop a design that meets all prevailing safety requirements with minimal loss of cargo capacity and low additional build costs.
The resulting design – Low Emission Advanced Products Tanker (LEAP) – has been granted Approval in Principle by classification society DNV GL. The vessel will have a service speed of 14.5 knots and effective range of 17,400 nautical miles using methanol as primary fuel and an effective range of 21,900 nautical miles using very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO).
“HMD is pleased to have provided initial and detailed design for the LEAP vessel design using the experience accumulated from successful dual fuel methanol carriers for numerous international owners. This design results in estimated cargo loss of 0.5% for a low construction premium, providing shipowners with the ability to build a low emissions vessel today,” said YH Chung, Head of Initial Design Department, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard.
The Methanol Institute believes the next few years will be crucial ones for the adoption of fuels that can begin to have an impact on global carbon emissions from shipping. Huge investment will be required to produce renewable fuels and owners may have to demonstrate that they have taken steps to address their environmental performance in order to access fresh capital in future.
“This vessel design demonstrates that newbuild or conversion can be straightforward and cost effective and extends the trading life of the asset as it can use renewable Methanol as more becomes available,” said Chris Chatterton, chief operating officer of The Methanol Institute."
Uniper Energy and Neutral Fuels team up to provide biofuels at Fujairah,"November 25, 2020",https://splash247.com/uniper-energy-and-neutral-fuels-team-up-to-provide-biofuels-at-fujairah/,"German energy firm Uniper Energy, through its marine fuel unit Uniper Energy DMCC (UED), has formed a partnership with UAE-based Neutral Fuels to provide maritime biofuel in Fujairah, UAE.
The two companies will blend UED’s very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and Neutral Fuels’ biofuel, creating a maritime fuel that meets the IMO standard.
“The collaboration is aimed to address climate protection, the predominant social issue in the world today. UED’s mission is to help countries build up reliable and environmentally friendly energy supplies to support a global transition to cleaner energy. Collaborating with Neutral Fuels enables us to accelerate our efforts,” said Lars Liebig, managing director of UED.
According to Liebig, the fuel will be available for large tankers and containerships, and for smaller short sea and feeder vessels.
“It is fitting for the UAE to lead the way in making maritime biofuel widely available to the shipping industry. The UAE was quick to adopt the UN’s sustainable development goals and has been particularly active in working to cut emissions of CO2. This is the main culprit that creates the greenhouse gases which cause climate change,” said Gary Hubbard, chief commercial officer of Neutral Fuels."
Modern atomic versus future fuels,"October 1, 2020",https://splash247.com/modern-atomic-versus-future-fuels/,"Mikal Bøe, CEO of CORE-POWER, writes today on how lifecycle economics stack up.
As the second oldest profession in the world, shipping is also the most fiercely competitive and capitalistic of all markets. Technologies that are either uneconomical or lead to losses don’t survive long in our markets.
Cheap fuel from the bottom of the barrel at oil refineries, has propelled the motorship to a point where low costs survive while the concept of investing in expensive, quality driven solutions does not. That era is coming to an end and we are now being asked to switch from cheap and dirty fuels, to clean and sustainable propulsion.
That has given birth to a red-hot market for ‘green’ technology and initiatives on how to reach zero emissions, and it’s becoming ever harder to tell the difference between decarbonising, renewable and sustainable energy.
Sustainable energy may not be decarbonising, renewable energy may not be sustainable, and decarbonising energy may not be renewable.
What matters most is a substantial reduction in emissions, carbon or not, and to make that shift economically sustainable so we can move forward, not backwards.
Sustainability accounts for the Total Life Cycle of an asset. Not just emissions and economics under operation, but also what comes before and after. Mining, smelting, industrial production, transport, maintenance, recovery, decommissioning and recycling. A full cycle of energy consumption and resource usage, without which the ‘asset’ could not exist.
When we look at the total life cycle of the building, running and scrapping of ships, we soon realise that it takes more than just ideology and good intentions to make a meaningful impact.
The EU, the US and other jurisdictions will gradually, but most certainly, start to impose pollution penalties, carbon taxes and emission levees on transport and industry, and when they do that, they will look at the total life cycle footprint of assets to measure how light or heavy such fines should be.
Adding pollution penalties to combustion fuels, that cover the ‘externalities’ of before-and-after consumption, inevitably make those fuels a lot more expensive than what we’ve become used to. Then comes a share of the supply chain infrastructure required to switch from fossil fuels to ‘green fuels’. Some suggest that could be a US$1.4 trillion bill to be paid by shipping and its customers over the next decades. In a well-coordinated world, the penalties would be used to pay for that infrastructure; but we don’t live in a well-coordinated world.
Then there is the significant challenge to select the right energy source which we need to move ships around. Switching to zero-carbon fuels, the most prominent of which is ‘green ammonia’ (green NH3), is unlikely to prove economically competitive for shipping unless it can be bought for less than half the price of fossil fuels. This is because green NH3 contains less than half the energy content (18-20 vs 44 MJ/Kg) and takes up 4.1 times the volume compared to 380CST bunker fuel.
That in turn means you must burn more than twice the amount of NH3 to get the same power output from your engine and need to quadruple the size of your fuel tanks to carry it around. To work, NH3 has to be below half the price of LNG or diesel, after adding pollution taxes to those fossil fuels.
To be truly ‘green’ that new fuel must be produced by a zero-emission energy source. Not just under operation, but for a Total Life Cycle, hence accounting for emissions from energy used in production and decommissioning of the energy source, in addition to what we may have from operations. In a normal world, that would add pollution taxes to ‘renewables’ as well, making it virtually impossible to get the price of NH3 below that of gas or diesel, unless production energy is free, and therefore not economically competitive.
The reality is that the only viable technology which can deliver a durable combination of close-to-zero emissions, marine-level reliability, walk-away safety and competitive economics, is atomic energy. The most effective way to make cheaper green synthetic fuels is therefore with atomic power, not ‘renewables, and especially not intermittent renewables.
Not ‘old nuclear’, like the technology that is used in power stations, on naval submarines, aircraft carriers and ice breakers, but new advanced ‘atomic battery’ technology in the form of the marine Molten Salt Reactor (the m-MSR). The m-MSR can provide all the positive benefits of atomic energy, without the negative problems of old nuclear.
Green synthetic fuels could work well for smaller ships in combination with efficient internal combustion engines, fuel cells and batteries. For the smallest 40,000 ships this could be the most economical and environmentally sustainable way forward. These are not as exposed to competition in brutal charter markets, and see much lower volatility in earnings.
With m-MSR power, floating production vessels could be positioned where fuel is needed. Making green fuels from air (Nitrogen) and water (Hydrogen) to create green ammonia (NH3) can be done in ports, substantially reducing the need for a trillion-dollar supply chain to be built around green fuels. Such floating production units could produce to meet demand, and switch to production of fuels for urban transport and infrastructure when demand for green marine fuel is lower. Production vessels could, and should, be owned by professionally run private companies.
For the largest 20,000 ships, green fuels will not be economical and installing an onboard m-MSR power unit makes the most financial sense. With an m-MSR, the fuel and coolant are the same, and exist at a constant ambient pressure. A leak in a pipe would not result in the expulsion of fuel and coolant. The molten salts in an m-MSR have extremely high heat capacity as well, so they too can absorb a lot of heat. This is a major safety advantage that enables passive decay heat removal. With no moving parts, and no engineering requirements for a refuelling system, the m-MSR can be mass-manufactured as a small compact ‘atomic battery pack’. That will drive the price down to very competitive levels.
Diesel engines are cheap but maintenance and fuel over the lifetime of the ship is expensive. On VLSFO, the total propulsion costs including Capex and Opex of a Triple-E Container ship can be more than $950m over a 20-year period sailing at full service-speed. m-MSRs are fuelled for life so are more expensive up front, but OPEX over the lifetime of the ship is very low. A Triple-E containership could be up to 30% cheaper to run on full service-speed with an m-MSR ‘battery pack’ over a 20-year period compared to one burning VLSFO, and potentially over 70% cheaper than the same ship burning green NH3.
A smart combination of mass-manufacturing (lower costs) and leasing (spread those costs over time), can bring both CAPEX and OPEX down to way below the cost of using a diesel engine or a gas turbine for most of the largest 20,000 ships in the global fleet.
For the past 40 years, the biggest obstacle to the development of advanced reactor technologies has been the swell of public distrust of ‘nuclear’ as a result of several high-profile terrestrial accidents involving conventional nuclear reactors also known as Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs).
The m-MSR should be one of the main catalysts that turns public opinion in favour of new-nuclear, fuelled by a techno-optimism among young people, around our ability of mitigate climate change and create a zero-emission energy system which is safe, durable and scalable.
The dramatically enhanced safety characteristics of the m-MSR will prove that atomic batteries can be used at sea, on land, in proximity to people in cities and for industry and emerging economies to leapfrog the painful energy transition from fossil fuels and deep into a zero-emission energy future where the economic competitiveness of shipping can be reborn.

The nuclear option,"August 25, 2020",https://splash247.com/the-nuclear-option/,"Mikal Bøe, CEO of CORE-POWER, argues atomic batteries make the most sense for shipping to slash its carbon footprint.
Finding a ‘magic bullet’ that will provide shipping with dramatically reduced GHG and CO2 emissions, looks like a long and tortuous road, as pressure increases from governments and environmental groups. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated with unanimous approval from 197 countries that shipping must reduce emissions by 50% of the 2008 total before 2050. This means an actual emission reduction of almost 90% by 2050.

Atomic batteries are being developed that would not need refuelling for up to 30 years
The ‘seascape’ is that there are some 60,000 cargo ships plying their trade on the oceans of the world and it seems a mammoth undertaking to implement the necessary changes to ensure that shipping reaches those targets within the mandated timeframe. New ships may be designed as ‘zero carbon’ or ‘carbon neutral’, but what of the energy sources that will deliver those reduced emissions? Pushing emissions from sea to land and relying on super-low density, intermittent renewable energy will only make matters worse, not better.
The reality is that the only viable technology which can deliver a durable combination of close-to-zero emissions, marine-level reliability, walk-away safety and competitive economics, is atomic energy. Not ‘old nuclear’, like the technology that is used on naval submarines, aircraft carriers and ice breakers which is totally unsuited to commercial shipping, but new advanced ‘atomic battery’ technology. This would provide all the positive benefits of atomic energy, without the negative problems of old nuclear.
Zero emissions would come as standard
Old nuclear has a major image problem. Large, ugly, evil looking machines that require billions spent on containment to make sure they don’t blow up. They don’t usually, but public opinion is a big hurdle. For most people, it’s all about the fear of exposure to strong radiation from accidents, and of nuclear material falling into the hands of the ‘wrong people’.
Now, excitement is building at the centre of our industry around the development of ‘atomic batteries’ for marine propulsion. These would be mass-manufactured power units based on marine Molten Salt Reactors (m-MSRs), a radical departure from nuclear as we know it. m-MSRs promise delivery of ample, reliable energy for fully electric large ships (suezmax to VLCCs, cape to VLOCs and panamax to Triple-Es etc) that would not need refuelling for up to 30 years. Zero emissions would come as standard.Safety is in every respect the primary aspect of any atomic machine, it is also the basis on which public opinion is formed. Losing coolant in a reactor is potentially disastrous and is a challenge that is largely responsible for the poor public image of ‘old nuclear’. In the m-MSR atomic battery, the fuel is the coolant and the coolant is the fuel, so coolant cannot be lost. What happened at Chernobyl or Fukushima is unthinkable with an m-MSR.
Since there would be no refuelling, there would be no handling of spent fuels and therefore no practical proliferation issue of atomic material to deal with. That level of passive, walk-away safety is unprecedented, even in gas and diesel technology. The m-MSR ‘atomic battery’ promises enormous liquid energy under no pressure to run a 35MW VLCC for 20 years at close to 30% less than the cost of VLSFO, and as much as 70% cheaper than green ammonia, with no emissions and no refuelling stops.
Core-Power, based in London, is working with a consortium of leading m-MSR developers to build atomic batteries that can be used for electric propulsion in very large ships. The technology can also provide green electric power and industrial heat for rapid mass-production of synthetic electro-fuels such as green ammonia for smaller ships.
Plans include installing m-MSRs on floating production vessels to make synthetic green fuels for smaller ships, producing fuel where it is needed, substantially reducing infrastructure costs when compared to other natural energy sources such as super-low density solar and wind power.
M-MSR spent fuel can be recycled into terrestrial power production and used for up to 150 years per load, leaving a small amount of waste.

A leasing model for these batteries could be similar to those for aircraft engines
There will be opportunities to eliminate the need for smokestacks or exhaust systems, so the ship’s engine room size can be reduced and the additional space used for more cargo. The number of onboard engineers can be downsized, as only turbines and electric systems will need regular maintenance.
Ports will also be able to use energy from ships installed with m-MSR to power equipment and machinery while the ship is at berth, through reverse cold ironing. Power generated by m-MSR will be cost competitive when compared to terrestrial energy sources available to the port.
Vessel operators have the opportunity to create revenue or reduce ports costs by bartering energy supply for port charges, while the port will also reduce its carbon footprint.
While volatility in the cost of bunker fuel during the last 20 years has been a constant headache for ship operators and shippers alike, m-MSR batteries deliver zero volatility in the cost of propulsion, enabling longer term cargo contracts without BAFs or rate adjustments, leading to profit visibility and better financing of ships.
A leasing model for m-MSR batteries could be similar to those for aircraft engines with through-life maintenance and ‘battery’ monitoring provided from remote.
While the debate continues about which fuels or energy sources should be developed for shipping’s greener future, the m-MSR atomic batteries ticks all of the boxes. Faster, cheaper, clean electric ships, is a game changer for ocean transport."
How green ammonia could power 30% of the merchant fleet by 2050,"August 14, 2020",https://splash247.com/how-green-ammonia-could-power-30-of-the-merchant-fleet-by-2050/,"A new report by Alfa Laval, Hafnia, Haldor Topsoe, Vestas and Siemens Gamesa has suggested that renewable ammonia could eventually power 30% of the global maritime fleet.
The 59-page study forecasts that once the fuel’s logistics chain has been fully developed – including the construction of 150m tonnes per year of incremental production capacity – green ammonia would have a cost similar to today’s compliant oil-based bunkers.
The report highlights what fraction of the Earth would be needed to create the renewable resources to create enough green ammonia to power 30% of the world’s merchant fleet (pictured below).
Ernest Hemingway once said that people tend to go bankrupt in two ways – gradually then suddenly
The report also estimates that the cost of today’s conventional ammonia is already comparable to VLSFO or MGO.
“Ernest Hemmingway (sic) once said that people tend to go bankrupt in two ways – gradually then suddenly. Technological change and transitions tend to happen in the same way, what once seemed impossible and then unfeasible, becomes possible and then finally the standard,” the study noted, going on to give the rise of electric cars in recent years as an example.
Ammonia developments are happening fast across the shipping industry with leading engine manufacturers readying their first engines for commercial use and this week Japanese line Nippon Yusen Kaisha teaming with compatriot yard Japan Marine United and ClassNK to commercialise the use of ammonia-fuelled ships. Likewise, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in South Korea has just laid out plans to commercialise ammonia-fuelled ships by 2025.
January saw Malaysia’s flagship carrier MISC along with Samsung Heavy Industries, Lloyd’s Register and MAN Energy Solutions set about building a landmark ammonia-fuelled tanker. Elsewhere, in a world-first, it was announced that Eidesvik’s 2003-built LNG-fuelled platform supply vessel Viking Energy will have a high-power fuel-cell installed to allow it to be powered by green ammonia.
In October last year, Maersk, the world’s largest containerline, identified three fuels to focus on, namely alcohol, biogas and ammonia as it transitions towards complete decarbonisation by 2050.

Shipping’s decarbonisation puzzle: a barometer of industry views,"July 21, 2020",https://splash247.com/shippings-decarbonisation-puzzle-a-barometer-of-industry-views/,"Castrol’s Cassandra Higham reveals details of a decarbonisation survey her firm carried out with owners, operators and managers.
Shipping is on a journey towards decarbonisation. The next ten years look set to be some of the most transformative years on record, as the industry adapts to the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) target to reduce CO₂ emissions by at least 40% by 2030. 
Decarbonisation of the shipping industry is the end goal, but the pathway has several milestones. We passed one of these in January 2020, when the global sulphur cap was implemented.  
A significant share of shipping’s decarbonisation mission will be achieved in the engine room. New low-carbon fuels and more efficient engines are likely to be key contributors to the reduction in emissions. Similar to the sulphur cap, such changes could drive immense technical challenges at a time of acute capital constraint for owners and operators. 
We believe that decarbonisation is a puzzle of several parts. That is why, in early 2020, Castrol surveyed 50 high-level individuals including owners, operators and managers, to get a sense of the industry’s understanding of this decarbonisation challenge.
Our questions did not anticipate COVID-19 and the fresh challenges it has created for our sector. Nevertheless, the results are fascinating, and reveal tremendous insight into how leading figures in our sector see the future unfolding.  
Our questions explored three areas: sulphur cap implementation, the integration of alternative fuels, and preparing for decarbonisation. Castrol sees these as the three biggest pieces of the puzzle required to make significant progress in rapidly, and profitably, achieving a zero-carbon future for shipping. 
Adapting to global sulphur regulations
The sulphur cap joins a list of emissions regulations that have tested the shipping industry, ahead of imminent IMO carbon targets for 2030 and 2050.
Rewinding to 1 January 2020, from a technical and engine point of view the transition was reasonably smooth. There were pockets of supply challenges for some operators in certain markets, with IMO data suggesting that Brazil was the worst impacted country for VLSFO availability in the first part of 2020.
Around 60% of our interviewees tended to agree, saying that they believed the sector was adapting “well” or “very well”. Long-term planning ahead of implementation appears to have paid off.  
However, half of respondents raised concerns regarding compliant fuel availability and the integrity of supply chains in the medium term. Some raised a concern that the industry’s response was not as radical or collaborative as it could have been. One key lesson learnt from the sulphur cap is that future environmental regulations need to prompt a more active response from the industry. 
Alternative fuel uncertainty
Next, we examined alternative fuels and how major owners and operators are preparing for a future with lower carbon, alternative fuels.  
It is fair to say that the transition to these future fuels represents the biggest single hurdle the shipping industry must overcome to meet its decarbonisation targets. To navigate it successfully, we will need an unprecedented level of collaboration between fuel suppliers, OEMs, lubricant providers and owners, operators and managers. 
Unsurprisingly, the adoption of alternative fuels has remained on the low side; only 28% of respondents had engaged with a supplier or put plans in place to do so in the near future.  
The survey results clearly show that alternative fuel suppliers will need to be more confident in their capabilities once they are being used at scale. These results reveal that major owners and operators believe that a large part of shipping’s fuel mix will continue to rely on the fossil status quo of VLSFO, ULSFO and LNG for at least 15 years.
It was better news for biofuels suppliers, who came top of the rankings after fossil fuels, with 77% of respondents confident that methanol and biofuels will be widely used by 2035. 
However, the prospects for hydrogen and ammonia were viewed in a less promising light. These fuels were the lowest ranked in terms of confidence, with 46% and 42% of respondents respectively having “low” to “very little confidence” in their commercial viability as a future fuel.  
Owners and operators want to understand the credible solutions on offer so they can reasonably trial and test. This sets the challenge for all lower carbon fuel suppliers to help prove to the market their solutions are viable.
Decarbonisation momentum
Finally, we examined decarbonisation planning. More than half said their organisations had undertaken “some planning”. Around 30% had undertaken no or limited planning. However, at the time of questioning – January 2020 – it can be argued that reducing carbon was not on the industry’s mind while implementing the sulphur cap. 
As the previous section explored, low-carbon fuel and engine testing and innovation is still at a relatively early stage within shipping. Once these solutions approach market maturity, it is likely that shipowners and operators will feel they have the assurance needed to move their own decarbonisation planning forward. 
On a brighter note, positive steps are being taken concerning emissions targets. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they are aware that their organisation had set emissions reduction targets. 
These organisational targets are encouraging first steps on the road to decarbonisation. 
A call for direction
While the ‘test for emissions legislation’ with the sulphur cap was felt to have gone smoothly, it is clear ship owners and operators are waiting for more assurance about low carbon and alternative fuels. Only then could they move to decarbonisation transformation their fleets.  Survey respondents were clear in their call for direction and collaboration if we, as an industry, are to decarbonise successfully and seamlessly.
One respondent effectively summarised the overriding sentiment as: “The 2020 Sulphur Cap is just a mid-point to decarbonisation. To me, it is only the start of many more changes and adjustments that the maritime sector must make to reduce the impact of our activities.”"
ASP brings bunker tanker to Fremantle for BP charter,"May 20, 2020",https://splash247.com/asp-brings-bunker-tanker-to-fremantle-for-bp-charter/,"Australia’s ASP Ships Group has brought in 2019-built bunker tanker

Mayday: Liners negotiate April but brace for incoming storm,"May 1, 2020",https://splash247.com/mayday-liners-negotiate-april-but-brace-for-incoming-storm/,"Lessons learned from the global financial crisis have helped staunch losses for the world’s top liners who held firm in April, blanked record numbers of sailings, and managed to record higher rates for last month than in the same period last year.
Crunching the numbers for the past month, Lars Jensen, the CEO of SeaIntelligence Consulting, noted via a LinkedIn post today that for the contract indices, the CCFI is 9% higher year-on-year and the Xeneta Shipping Index (XSI) is 11% higher.
For the spot indices the SCFI is 9% higher and the World Container Index (WCI) is 11% higher.
In the Pacific the SCFI and WCI spot rates are up between 0.2% – 2.9% depending on coast and index chosen. The contract rates, however, are up 12% according to CCFI.
For Asia- Europe the SCFI and WCI spot indices are up 12% to North Europe and 18-21% to the Mediterranean. The CCFI contract rates are up 5% to North Europe and 15% to the Mediterranean.
From XSI the combined US import index is 33% higher and the Europe import index is up 7.5%
“With VLSFO bunker fuel for April 2020 being 37% lower than IFO380 fuel in April 2019 we should expect some lowering of rate levels going forward to account for the fuel effect. However, in terms of base rate levels compared to last year there are not yet quantitative signs that the carriers are about to break ranks,” Jensen wrote today.
Appearing on this site’s Maritime CEO Leader Series last week, Jensen warned the container shipping sector will get hit “disproportionally” hard compared to other cargo sectors.
Jensen predicted that carriers will suffer a combined 10% volume drop this year, but he praised liners’ collective resolve thus far in holding the line on freight rates.
Having negotiated the past month well carriers are facing up to darkening prospects in May, a month that CMA CGM’s Rodolphe Saade said recently would be the toughest for all liners.
The latest XSI Public Indices report from Xeneta show that rates actually climbed during April. The rise, although small at 0.7%, reverses the decline seen in March, reinstating a trend of gradual monthly increases that began in October 2019.
Xeneta CEO Patrik Berglund commented in a release earlier this week: “Carriers have been working hard to make adjustments to protect rates, aggressively withdrawing capacity from the market and adopting more creative strategies.”
“Carriers are, and will be, subject to huge pressure in the immediate future,” Berglund added. “A disciplined approach will help safeguard rates, but, given the economic dire straits, will individual carriers hold ranks or be forced to reduce rates in a bid to secure business and claim market share?”
Carriers will have looked at the latest Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMI) readings for April with concern as they clearly show a massive weakening of global manufacturing.
“The manufacturing PMI readings serve as a bellwether for container shipping volumes for the months ahead, and recent data suggest that 2020 will be a stress-test for container carriers, perhaps on an unprecedented scale,” BIMCO’s chief shipping analyst Peter Sand wrote in a new report published yesterday.
Flash PMI readings in the US and Eurozone composites declined to 36.9 and 33.6 index points respectively, while China’s manufacturing PMIs in April highlighted sluggish recovery from March. The PMI figure from Caixin highlighted a contraction to 49.4 index points, while the figure from the National Bureau of Statistics China (NBS) showed an expansion to 50.8 index points.
The common denominator between the two was the New Export Orders sub index (at 33.5 points), which in both cases plummeted amid slowing demand from the rest of the world.
Global manufacturing activity is slowing on the back of the constrained labour force and faltering demand, and data from the US Census Bureau highlight how US retail sales effectively slammed into a brick wall in March 2020. As the US entered a state of lockdown in March, clothing and clothing accessories stores saw retail sales drop 50% from February 2020 as well as year-on-year.
Similarly, sales in furniture stores dropped 26.8% from February, while motor vehicle and parts dealers had their sales slashed by 25.6%, also compared with February. The products and parts sold in these types of stores constitute a significant fraction of all seaborne containerised goods, and such dramatic drops in US retail sales are indicative of the calamity that container carriers face.
2020 is now expected to see the sharpest contraction in global seaborne container trade on record according to the world’s largest broker, Clarksons Platou, who issued a sobering box report last Friday.
The massive volume of blanked sailings announced in recent weeks is set to create new records in terms of the inactive containership fleet, which analysts at Alphaliner are now saying will breach the 3m teu mark for the first time meaning some 13% of the entire global box fleet will be out of work.
According to Sea- Intelligence, the volume loss alone from the record number of pandemic-linked blanked sailings will cost the top 15 carriers more than $6bn in 2020, rendering the industry loss-making in 2020, reversing the $5.9bn profit the top 15 carriers managed combined last year. Sea-Intelligence warned that a failure to prevent a simultaneous rate collapse could lead to the liner industry losing a “staggering” $23.4bn in 2020.”

Remember the good old days when we thought IMO 2020 would be challenging? Little did we know. Covid-19 has generated the most rapid shift in global economic health ever seen – triggering a collapse in oil prices and a crisis in shipping markets – and rendering concerns around IMO 2020 as seeming almost inconsequential.
Clarksons recently predicted a 5% contraction in shipping in 2020, but that is increasingly looking like a conservative assessment. Bunker demand will reduce; shipping contraction means lower freight rates and problems for containers and dry bulk, yet the tanker market is clearly the one outlier, and a boon looks likely for a sector that has suffered in recent years.
Yet, if the economic ripple effects of Covid-19 desist sooner than anticipated we could see tanker rates take a severe blow. This risk will be further exacerbated should oil production ease significantly, which will see rates drop. However, if Covid-19 persists in continuing to lock down societal and economic norms, and oil keeps flowing, then expect it to be a great year to operate tankers.
Conversely, for the dry bulk, container and cruise sectors, the picture is bleak. Recent M&A activity in the liner sector undoubtedly offers some protection, but it would not be a surprise to see bankruptcies; we all expected the Korean government to bail out Hanjin, but they didn’t. Nevertheless, we should anticipate that national governments will protect key shipping companies (noting that the US government wants to help the cruise industry, for example).
From the perspective of the bunker markets, the spreads of almost $300 per tonne enjoyed by gleeful shipowners with scrubbers installed in January and February 2020 have disappeared – replaced with differentials in main ports of below $50 per tonne at the time of writing. So the focus with most buyers is now on buying VLSFO. Those who have installed and paid for scrubbers will naturally still try and buy HSFO where available, but with overall prices and spreads low, we are seeing a seemingly unthinkable scenario in January, where even shipowners with scrubbers are almost ambivalent as to whether they take VLSFO or HSFO.
Certainly no one is going to invest in scrubbers in this climate, and some who have invested will surely regret their decision. Scrubbing economics were already showing weakness before Covid-19 as it became apparent there was less HSFO available coupled with reports that some suppliers in small ports were charging very high prices with large margins for HSFO supply. So it’s my view that, even without the COVD-19 triggered collapse in oil prices, we would be looking at a smaller market for scrubbers.
Conversely, at least there is demand for VLSFO (there is no demand for gasoline) – and we are seeing refiners face a direct choice between processing vacuum gasoil (VGO) into gasoline or sending it into the VLSFO pool – a factor that has already depressed VLSFO prices a little. Overall there appears to be plenty of product.
It remains to be seen whether the collapse of Hin Leong in Singapore will be the tip of the iceberg and we will see other suppliers and, or traders fall. The Singapore MPA’s decision to assure the market that bunker supply chains were intact – amid genuine concerns that banks will pull financial liquidity from the supply chain – and approve bunker licenses for Trafigura and Mercuria (Minerva) to fill the Hin Leong supply gap, tells its own story.
From a bunker fuel quality perspective, Covid-19 and its effects may ironically improve quality, as we will see better streams coming ex-refinery and probably less incentive to push blended fuels. While, on the other hand, much of the initial quality of VLSFO was good coming from straight run low sulphur residual fuel. VGO, which we are seeing refiners push into the ‘bunker pool’ frequently now, is likely to be more problematic from a compatibility and stability point of view.
One could be forgiven for forgetting shipping’s new, even bigger, challenge; decarbonisation, and the need to explore new low and zero carbon fuels and energy. I like to think that this rare period of reflection afforded to us can stimulate an ‘intelligent recovery’ that sees less business as usual, and allows markets to pivot. Signs were certainly there for shipping pre COVID-19, and sensible investors in shipping will recognise this. That has to be the hope, and there are signs to this effect in other sectors.
Adrian Tolson will be joined by Jan Christensen, senior director purchasing and supply at Hapag-Lloyd and Charlotte Rojgaard, technical manager for marine fuels at Bureau Veritas on Wednesday to discuss these issues. Click this link to find out more about this free webinar."
Price differential between low and high sulphur fuel down to $34 per ton at Europe’s largest bunkering hub,"April 16, 2020",https://splash247.com/price-differential-between-low-and-high-sulphur-fuel-down-to-34-per-ton-at-europes-largest-bunkering-hub/,"The price differential between shipping’s main two fuels at Europe’s largest bunkering port, Rotterdam, stands at just $34 per ton, one tenth of what the difference was at the start of the year.
The Hi5, as the price differential between low and high sulphur fuel oil is termed in the bunkering industry, had ducked below $50 per ton at Rotterdam for the first time earlier this week before a further narrowing of prices yesterday.
Elsewhere, the Hi5 is narrowing too with the average price differential among the top 20 bunkering ports in the world, as tracked by Ship&Bunker, standing at just $55 per ton, a far cry from the $343 peak difference recorded at the end of the first week of January this year.
The dramatic drop in prices for very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) combined with the rapidly worsening outlook for the world economy in recent weeks has seen many shipowners shelve scrubber retrofit projects.
In terms of gross tons, as of April 3, 14.9% of the global shipping fleet had been fitted with a scrubber, according to data from Clarkson Research Services."
Volatility and uncertainty on the tanker front,"April 10, 2020",https://splash247.com/volatility-and-uncertainty-on-the-tanker-front/,"Rebecca Galanopoulos Jones, head of research at Alibra Shipping, takes a look at the tanker market outlook for Q2.
For the first quarter of 2020, we have been dealing with an exceptionally unusual situation to say the very least due to the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to have an unprecedented impact globally. In the tanker market, we would usually expect some volatility in the first few months of the year due to the lunar new year celebrations in the far east, however this year saw average one-year t/c VLCC rates for tankers up 39% from last year, despite a fall in demand from China due to the virus. If the statistics are to be believed, the pandemic is said to be under control in the Far East but in Europe and in the US the situation has yet to peak and the situation is progressively becoming more serious.
The price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, caused the market to be flooded with oil. As a result, oil prices experienced the largest fall in oil prices seen since the Gulf War in 1991, sending VLCC earnings above $200,000, the highest levels seen since tanker rates peaked in October 2019. Period rates have also firmed off the back of the sentiment in the spot market and earlier this month we saw time charter estimate for a VLCC for one-year rose to an all-time high of $80,00/pdpr. This week rates have cooled off slightly as we await the outcome of the OPEC+ meeting which could finally see a deal reached on crude output cuts.
The last few weeks have seen over 43 VLCCs fixed on period charters, mainly for storage, however the strong sentiment hasn’t yet filtered down into the other sectors as much as owners would have liked and the emphasis remains strongly on the larger ships. Given the levels of uncertainty, it is impossible to predict what the long-term future for the tanker market will look like. In the short-term however, we expect to see firm rates for the next quarter but tailing off in Q3 which is traditionally the quiet season for the tanker market but it is not unheard of to see unusual patterns in the summer and winter months and if one thing is for certain, 2020 will be a yo-yo year for tanker markets.
On the clean side, we have seen increased interest in the LR2 sector for shorter periods of a maximum of a year, again for clean petroleum products storage, and fixture levels have moved up recently. Alibra has seen interest from traders for clean storage with one-two clean VLCCs soon to take delivery and to be filled up with gasoline instead of crude. It is not unheard of for traders to use new vessels to store clean petroleum products which can only be done with virgin tanks.
Low oil prices have been a glimmer of hope for Tanker operators. However, the reduction in the spread between IFO/VLSFO has made the economic case for scrubbers near redundant. Many owners either have scrubber installation pending and considering whether or not to proceed as the price differential between the very low sulphur fuel and regular blends is very small, making scrubbers not cost effective at the moment. Other owners who have already commenced scrubber installation, have had vessels stuck in dry dock in China, where work has come to a halt during the pandemic and consequently vessels have been unable to trade and make the most of the firm market rates.
Almost every person on the planet has been affected in some way by this virus and as such we have no answers as to how this will affect this shipping industry in the long term. In the short term, we are experiencing a period of volatility and uncertainty with no one able to predict what will happen on a day to day basis."
Owners cancel planned scrubber installations,"March 27, 2020",https://splash247.com/owners-cancel-planned-scrubber-installations/,"Reports are emerging of owners cancelling planned scrubber installations in China on account of the narrowing fuel price spread and the grim trade outlook brought about by the spread of coronavirus.
Alphatanker, part of AXS Marine, noted in its latest weekly report: “Installations due to be carried out in Chinese yards were already being delayed in the wake of Covid-19 and now following stellar returns for tankers, some owners are reportedly delaying or even, where possible, cancelling installations.”
Furthermore, reports suggest that owners of bulkers or liners struggling amid the global downturn are also cancelling scrubbers as they strive to cut costs.
“We fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg and as the global recession intensifies during the second quarter, this drip of cancellations could turn into a flood,” Alphatanker predicted.
Analysts at the tanker specialists have run the maths on the current price spread suggesting it would now take four years for a VLCC owner to pay off a scrubber investment if the price gap, known as the Hi5, remains at roughly today’s levels.
Putting a brave face on the current oil price picture, Ian Adams, executive director of the pro-scrubber lobby group, Clean Shipping Alliance 2020, maintained earlier this week that there was still a clear economic case to be made for the exhaust gas cleaning technology.
“Given the unprecedented circumstances we all find ourselves, we should not dwell too much on the narrowing fuel price spread. Bunker prices will undoubtedly be distorted due to the difficult and challenging post-coronavirus market, exacerbated by the spat between Russia and Saudi Arabia which is culminating in an oil surplus in a market where demand has reached a nadir,” Adams said in a release, adding: “Certainly, media reports concerning the narrowing of fuel prices should not be a deterrent to the wider take-up of marine exhaust gas cleaning systems as the technology remains the optimal, most effective means of meeting MARPOL Annex VI requirements. The use of EGCS also avoids the uncertainty surrounding the quality and availability of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO).”
Commenting on the the Alphatanker report, fuel expert Adrian Tolson, a director at consultancy BLUE Insight, told Splash today, “I think the big thing is that with the cost of VLSFO cheap and with shipowners’ propensity to live day-to-day in ship operations, it is not difficult for a shipowner to dump an investment that had returns in the future when they are looking at short-term survival.”"
Fuel price spread plummets to as low as $62 per tonne,"March 17, 2020",https://splash247.com/fuel-price-spread-plummets-to-as-low-as-62-per-tonne/,"Latest data from Ship&Bunker shows the average price spread between high and low sulphur fuel oil at the world’s 20 largest bunkering hubs stands at just $86 per tonne, putting scrubber investments into sharp focus.
In some ports the figures are even more narrow with Fujairah having a price spread yesterday of just $64 per tonne while the gap in prices for shipping’s top two fuels at Rotterdam yesterday was $62 per tonne.
In terms of general global patterns the price spread tends to be higher in the western hemisphere at the moment.
Pre-coronavirus, shipowners had been expecting the issues brought about the global sulphur cap – price spread, fuel compatibility and availability – to dominate daily operations in the first quarter of the year. However, after peaking on January 7, the price spread, known among bunker players as the Hi5, has narrowed fast by more than $220 per tonne as a global average to the point where calculations for scrubber payback times have had to be drastically reworked.
Speaking with sister title, Splash Extra last month, Rob Aarvold, general manager at Singapore-based owner Swire Bulk, said: “With the jump in the spread between VLSFO and HSFO to close to $350 per metric shortly after the implementation of the new IMO 2020 regulations on January 1 2020 all discussions centred around the validation of the scrubber strategy and the revised payback calculation. Subsequently this spread has collapsed to nearly $150 in Rotterdam, a pricing point that most advocates for the installation of scrubbers used as an outlier in the justification case.”
In practice the real spread is even more opaque given that most regular HSFO consumers are buying under contract, so with less spot activity and limited open market availability the spread remains somewhat theoretical and this is before incorporating delivery costs including waiting time for barge availability."
Shipping passes peak scrubber as fuel price spread stabilises,"March 6, 2020",https://splash247.com/shipping-passes-peak-scrubber-as-fuel-price-spread-stabilises/,"The tenth week of the year has finally brought some stability to the bunker price differential between high and low sulphur fuel oil (HSFO and LSFO) with some analysts suggesting the current spread will stretch through the year, bringing an end to further scrubber investments.
Ship&Bunker’s average price spread between HSFO and and LSFO today for the world’s 20 largest bunkering hubs stands at $126.5 per tonne. In certain ports the price spread has ducked into double-digit territory in recent days, such as Malta where the gap between shipping’s two dominant fuels is just $72.5 per tonne.
A report from brokers Braemar ACM suggested shipping has now past peak scrubber based on the likely price spread for the rest of the year.
 “Looking ahead the VLSFO-HSFO spread seems to be stabilising, and is not looking as intimidating as many once feared. Forward bunker prices for the balance 2020 indicate a differential of ~$140/t for the rest of the year. At this level, we don’t see owners rushing to place new orders for scrubbers,” Braemar ACM predicted, adding: “At the same time, $407/t VLSFO for the remainder of 2020, as suggested by the paper market, is not too difficult a pill to swallow for many owners: HSFO was pricing well above this level through 2011-14.”
 
The analysts at Braemar ACM said the shipping industry was now “over the hump” in terms of yard congestion due to IMO 2020.
Pre-coronavirus, shipowners had been expecting the issues brought about the global sulphur cap – price spread, fuel compatibility and availability – to dominate daily operations in the first quarter of the year.

Latest data from Clarkson Research Services shows that in terms of ship numbers 3.5% of the existing fleet is fitted with scrubbers, but given how scrubbers have tended to be chosen more for larger tonnage this represents 19% of the existing fleet in gt terms. For the orderbook, Clarkson data shows that 34.7% of all ships still to deliver in gt terms are contracted with scrubbers.

IMO 2020 and demolition volumes,"February 25, 2020",https://splash247.com/imo-2020-and-demolition-volumes/,"Is there a discernible scrapping trend brought about by the eight-week-old global sulphur cap? Jason Jiang investigates.
The new IMO sulphur regulations, coupled with continued recession in the dry bulk chartering market, has forced owners to push a large number of less fuel-efficient vintage ships to scrapyards in the first two months of this year. The trend is expected to be sustained in the first half of this year, as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus in China, which could have a further downward impact on the freight market.
“We are already seeing an increased supply of vessels for recycling due to the IMO 2020 regulations,” says Jamie Dalzell, a senior trader at cash buyer GMS.
According to Dalzell, around 15 capesize bulkers and VLOCs have already been sold for recycling this year as dry charter earnings suffer, with rates seen for much of this year below operating levels already.
Dalzell has also seen a steady supply of containerships this year heading from demo, particularly from the large liner companies whilst there have been fewer tankers than average sent for recycling in the first eight weeks of the year.
“We do expect a sustained supply of particularly dry bulk and container vessels for scrapping this year as it becomes increasingly challenging to run vessels due to depressed freight rates and higher VLSFO fuel costs and scrubber installation costs,” Dalzell says.
Allied Shipbroking described the state of imbalance in the ship recycling market in a recent report.
“The dry bulk sector started on the wrong foot from the very start of the year, with the scene in the freight market being a picture of complete disarray and freight earnings reach in some cases all time lows. Given this, an excessive tonnage capacity has been pushed towards the demolition market over the past few days, with breakers seemingly looking to accommodate as much tonnage as possible,” Allied Shipbroking says.
Seasure Shipbroking’s latest Green Report, released on February 19, shows that so far in 2020 there have been 16 capesize bulkers sent to scrapyards, comparing with only five in same period in 2019.
“We note that these vessels are all without scrubber. This is a sign of the currently low dry bulk market and owners choosing to recycle vessels rather than waiting for an upswing in the market and committing more capital to maintaining vessels and passing upcoming surveys,” says Sam Tucker, an analyst at VesselsValue.
“Additionally the clean tanker markets are low and this is why we’re seeing an increase in the small tanker recycling activity,” Tucker adds.
Tucker believes the advent of IMO 2020 sulphur rules have impacted scrapping rates too as the new regulatory framework is encouraging owners to decide to recycle vessels earlier. Tucker estimates that IMO 2020 and the poor charter market will result in recycling rates being high in the first half of 2020.
Braemar ACM Shipbroking has also noticed that the demolition volume of feeder boxships is increasing.
“We are seeing feeders trickle onto the market as employment opportunities are currently few and far between,” Braemar said in its latest weekly container briefing report.
James Frew, a director at Maritime Strategies International, reckons ultimately the impact of IMO 2020 on scrapping volumes will see older ships being scrapped as higher fuel costs reduce the net earnings and desirability of older, less fuel efficient vessels.
“To date this effect has been dwarfed by wider issues in the market, with coronavirus coupled with seasonal weakness driving down earnings with the problems particularly severe in the dry bulk market where they were compounded by strong newbuilding deliveries in January. This has resulted in significant scrapping of bulkers but we would attribute that principally to the market rather than the narrow impact of IMO 2020,” Frew says.
Clarkson Research Services noted in a recent report that many owners are not hesitating in disposing of their vintage units due to the continued depressed freight market, which in the short term has no clear outcome on when it will bottom out. This has been further compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.
“With ports now placing restrictions on vessels coming in and out of China, as well as trade routes and deliveries in the region, this could have a further downward impact on the freight market and sentiment as a whole. This could in turn, cause more vessels to come for recycling and provide the industry with a rush of tonnage not seen since the early months of 2018, when many feel the market was last at its most prominent,” Clarksons suggested."
"Maersk makes late scrubber run, set to increase HFO use by 150%","February 21, 2020",https://splash247.com/maersk-makes-late-scrubber-run-set-to-increase-hfo-use-by-150/,"Maersk, the world’s largest containerline, is set to more than double the amount of heavy fuel oil (HFO) its fleet consumes by the end of the year.
During an investor call at yesterday’s 2019 results briefing, Maersk, previously in the anti-scrubber camp, revealed it is now signed up to a large number of exhaust gas cleaning systems.
Maersk’s current fuel consumption is split with 10% for 0.1% sulphur fuel covering ECA zones, 80% for very low sulphur fuel oil and 10% HFO. The plan, revealed yesterday, is to increase HFO usage to 25% by the end of 2020.
Maersk uses approximately 12m tons of bunker fuel annually so by the end of the year it could be using 3m tons of HFO, depending on scrubber fitting delays at Chinese yards brought about by the coronavirus.
The price differential between HFO and VLSFO has now ducked below $200 per tonne.
Maersk has gradually changed its stance on scrubbers. Initially against them, as the global sulphur cap approached it decided to buy around 30 scrubber kits to trial the technology. It has since committed far more to the devices, as have many of its peers, especially for larger boxships. 2M partner MSC is the liner to have invested most in scrubber kits, buying around 250 units so far.
More than 10% of the world’s containership capacity was fitted with scrubbers by the start of the global sulphur cap on January 1, with analysts at Alphaliner predicting the number could grow to some 1,000 ships – equating to 10m teu – by the end of 2022.
Also yesterday, Maersk CEO Soren Skou discussed how the coronavirus has been affecting his business with the Danish carrier cancelling more than  50 sailings since the Chinese New Year.
Skou warned that the world’s biggest ocean carrier is experiencing significant disruption at Chinese seaports due to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak.
“We are experiencing huge pressure at [Chinese] terminals because there aren’t enough workers at the ports to move the containers around, not enough truck drivers to move the goods, and no one to receive them at the factories or warehouses,” Skou said.
Skou said Maersk estimates factories in China are operating at 50% to 60% of capacity, predicting production would ramp up to 90% by the first week of March."
Euronav: ‘When the cycle is down we can be opportunistic’,"February 13, 2020",https://splash247.com/euronav-when-the-cycle-is-down-we-can-be-opportunistic/,"Arguably no sector in shipping is more constantly on a knife edge than the VLCC sector, a segment prone to extremely rapid swings in earnings. A safe pair of hands is what is needed to navigate the supertanker seas and in Hugo De Stoop, Euronav has the right person for the job. A 15-year veteran at the Antwerp company, De Stoop stepped up from CFO to CEO 10 months ago.
Analysts – and Splash – gushed when on January 30 the Belgian tanker giant revealed its stunning $160.8m net profit for Q4. Citing “robust fundamentals” just two weeks ago, Euronav stated at the time how its VLCCs in January had been trading at $89,200 per day and the firm’s suezmaxes pocketing an average of $57,000 a day.
And then the full effects of coronavirus blew in, ushering in a precipitous drop in tanker fortunes, rarely seen in terms of its speed and severity. Chinese oil demand suddenly dropped by around 20% making it the largest demand shock the oil market has suffered since the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, and the most sudden since the September 11 attacks in the US in 2001. This combined with the recent lifting of sanctions on 26 Cosco VLCCs saw many of the world’s largest tankers plummet from earning six-figure daily sums last month to operating below opex.
However, for Euronav and De Stoop, this monumental change of fortunes has brought opportunities and he still maintains the fundamentals of the tanker sector remain an attractive proposition in an exclusive interview with Maritime CEO.
Yesterday, Euronav pounced for three Sinokor resale VLCCs due for delivery later this year and early 2021 from Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME). While most of the reporting surrounding the deal centred on the fact that the ships will be Euronav’s first to feature scrubbers, the real headline was the price paid – $93.5m per ship. Resales for the last couple of months had prior to this been priced for $100m or above.
De Stoop reminds readers that Euronav, throughout its history, has always been an opportunistic type of company.
“When the cycle is down we can be opportunistic to take ships at a good price to operate long term,” he says in connection with yesterday’s triple acquisition for $280.5m, saying that before the Sinokor deal prices had been too high for resales.
Ahead of the global sulphur cap, Euronav had been one of the most high profile opponents of going down the scrubber route, opting instead for a unique strategy of buying up huge volumes of VLSFO in early 2019 and sending it for storage to Malaysia on one of its ULCCs.
However, as De Stoop, ever the numbers man, stresses – reacting to all the scrubber headlines yesterday – Euronav’s stance was always regarding existing ships, not newbuilds.
“You can’t get a newbuild for prompt delivery without scrubbers,” he points out, adding: “We were not convinced about the economic case for scrubber retrofits.”
De Stoop says he and his team liked the three ships for all their specs and the price negotiated, not simply because they happened to have scrubbers installed. Indeed, De Stoop makes the point that Euronav would not have changed anything in its sulphur cap strategy if he had the time again.
On the coronavirus, the Belgian executive reckons the effects will be felt in the tanker trades into Q3, but by next winter China ought to be in a position to pick up demand.
“Yes, it is a catastrophe,” he concedes, “but we know it is temporary in nature, and when the Chinese come back they will accelerate.”
The actual supply fundamemtals of the tanker sector remain good, De Stoop argues, pointing to the limited orderbook in the coming 24 months and the tranche of ageing ships that will head for demo soon.
Pointedly on the virus, the boss of the largest independent crude oil tanker company in the world, tells Maritime CEO: “It’s been a good reminder to people in the tanker sector that rates can go up and down very quickly.”
Look out for the full interview with the Euronav boss in the next issue of Maritime CEO magazine including De Stoop’s take on tanker consolidation – “It’s only at the beginning” – and why tanker owners and operators ought to be more transparent in their CO2 emissions reporting.

Shipping bodies respond to black carbon claims,"February 3, 2020",https://splash247.com/shipping-bodies-respond-to-black-carbon-claims/,"A host of shipping bodies have replied in an open letter to the Clean Arctic Alliance in an ongoing spat about the potential for very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) to emit more black carbon emissions than high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO).
In the wake of a joint submission to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) from Finland and Germany that suggested some VLSFO blends had a higher amounts of aromatic compounds leading to greater black carbon output, the NGO Clean Arctic Alliance had asked the authors of last year’s joint industry guidance on the supply and use of VLSFO whether they were aware of the potentially greater polluting effects of the new fuel. The NGO sent the letter to shipping bodies including class, bunkering and naval architects.
The guidelines – published in August – were viewed at the time as a landmark study into the new fuel. The bodies behind them, including IACS, IBIA, IMarEST, RINA and CIMAC, have pointed out in replying to the NGO that the study was limited to operational aspects only and was developed to support suppliers, shipmanagers and seafarers prepare and implement the use of 0.50% sulphur fuels as safely as possible.
The guidelines suggested that the VLSFO would be more paraffinic – not aromatic – in nature.
“The information available since the introduction of the 0.50% sulphur limit on 1 January 2020, suggests our expectations have been generally correct,” the shipping bodies replied in their open letter.
The letter finished by noting: “To conclude, we fully agree that all black carbon related submissions (including the joint submission from Finland and Germany to IMO dated before the introduction of the 0.50% sulphur limit) should be reviewed thoroughly and seriously by the international fuel oil supply and shipping community. The upcoming IMO Pollution Prevention and Response Sub-Committee is the most effective forum to progress that debate.”
In a joint submission sent to the IMO in November last year by Finland and Germany, three months after the joint industry guidelines were published, it was noted that new hybrid fuels with 0.50% sulphur content contained a high proportion of aromatic compounds in a range of 70% to 95%, which resulted in increased [black carbon] emissions in a range of 10% to 85% compared to HSFO. The higher emissions were most noticeable when the engine was running at less than full capacity.
The Clean Arctic Alliance has called for the IMO to support an immediate switch to distillate fuels for ships in the Arctic and develop a global rule prohibiting fuels with high black carbon emissions."
"Euronav stuns with 57,534% Q4 improvement","January 30, 2020",https://splash247.com/euronav-stuns-with-57634-q4-improvement/,"For the tanker bulls, the eagerly anticipated Q4 results from Antwerp’s Euronav did not disappoint this morning.
The Belgian tanker giant posted a stunning $160.8m net profit for the final quarter of 2019, up by 57,534% from the $279,000 profit it eked out in the same quarter of 2018.
Moreover, Q1 looks like it will deliver sizeable profits with its VLCCs so far this month trading at $89,200 per day and the firm’s suezmaxes pocketing an average of $57,000 a day.
Euronav, the largest crude shipping firm by market capitalisation, timed the bull-run seen in the tanker trades since September well. More than 80% of its fleet were traded on the spot in the last few months, picking up huge six-figure deals.
Hugo De Stoop, CEO of Euronav, said today: “Tanker sector fundamentals improved further during Q4 to drive large tanker markets to their highest level since 2008. Specific catalysts have continued to influence short term freight rates – reflecting the current balance in market dynamics.”
De Stoop, who took over from arch-scrubber critic Paddy Rodgers last year, said that thanks to the tanker orderbook standing at 25-year lows and the limited appetite for newbuilds by both owners and banks at the moment the current cyclical upturn was “sustainable”.
Euronav took a different path to most of its VLCC peers when it came to compliance with the global sulphur cap, avoiding scrubbers and contracting instead early last year for huge quantities of VLSFO at cheap prices, which it then stored on its own ultra large crude carrier.
The company discussed how the IMO 2020 transition had gone today, once again hinting that under new management scrubber installations have not been ruled out entirely.
“The fuel procurement strategy implemented so far has provided Euronav adequate protection against higher fuel prices and a high degree of optionality going forward regarding fuel strategies. This includes the potential to install scrubber technology,” the company stated.
Euronav is anticipating that a further 96 VLCCs from the world’s tanker owners still plan to retrofit scrubbers during 2020 reducing the fleet capacity by 1.9%, providing what it described today as “a further positive driver to already robust fundamentals”.
Among other interesting points shared today by Euronav senior management today, it was revealed that last month saw the company hold its first meeting with a new committee – the ESG and Climate Committee.
Euronav also disclosed that this year it will get a rating from the Climate Disclosure Program (CDP) from which it then intends to develop what it described in a release today as “challenging” emission reduction targets."
"Bunker fuel price spreads tipped to have peaked, on course to fall below $200","January 24, 2020",https://splash247.com/fuel-price-spreads-tipped-to-have-peaked-on-course-to-fall-below-200/,"Scrubberless shipowners are breathing easier in the knowledge that 24 days into the global sulphur cap era it appears the industry has already passed the peak in terms of price spread between high and very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO).
In Singapore, the world’s top bunkering hub, prices for VLSFO peaked on January 7 at $740 per metric tonne and have been sliding ever since, closing yesterday at $627 per tonne, while in Rotterdam prices closed at $516.50. The price has also fallen in other ports around the world.
The price spread in Singapore has now dropped from a high of $343 per tonne to $259 as of yesterday, while in Rotterdam the gap could go below $200 today for the first time.
“The initial uptick in low-sulphur fuel oil prices marked the first wave of IMO2020, whereas the price levels are now declining towards a point of stabilization,” international shipowning organisation BIMCO stated in a release yesterday.
Nevertheless, despite the two fuels getting closer price-wise, BIMCO stated that the investment payback period for a scrubber is still between half a year to one and a half years, depending on the cost of the scrubber and daily consumption.
Ishaan Hemnani, founder of bunker brooking plartform, BunkerEx, told Splash today that waiting times for HSFO are increasing and many traders are only quoting for HSFO on reques, a sign, he said, that liquidity is thinning out. Traders were saying the same thing regarding VLSFO back in September 2019 when VLSFO was not readily available.
Ralph Leszczynski, global Head of research at Banchero Costa Group, said the price spike seen around the turn of the year had come about thanks to short term shortages of the new fuel.
“Once we get over the supply constraints on the new fuels, the spread will gradually narrow,” Leszczynski said today, predicting the equilibrium spread would be somewhere around $180 to $200 per tonne in Singapore.
Adrian Tolson, a director at consultants BLUE Insight, agreed with Leszczynski, saying the VLSFO market is slowly dealing with its early logistics issues, resulting in more competitive prices while the HSFO market is now seeing the results of low demand followed by low availability.
“The future is HSFO as a small volume, logistically challenging fuel choice.  In many ports with no consistent scrubber demand there will no supply.  HSFO buyers will face higher prices and greater bulk to retail premiums even in main ports,” Tolson said. 
In an ongoing poll carried on this site, 68% of Splash readers believe the price spread between the two fuels will be less than $200 per tonne by the end of the year. Remarkably, roughly one in eight voters so far believe HSFO will actually be more expensive than VLSFO by the end of 2020.

Maersk announces its first bunker fee hike in the global sulphur cap era,"January 23, 2020",https://splash247.com/maersk-announces-its-first-bunker-fee-hike-in-the-global-sulphur-cap-era/,"Maersk, the world’s largest containerline, has announced its first bunker fee hike in the global sulphur cap era.
With very low sulphur fuel oil proving to be more than $250 per ton more expensive than high sulphur fuel oil in the first three weeks of the new IMO 2020 regulation, Maersk has warned clients that effective March 1 it will hike bunker-related tariffs across all trades with an increase range between $50 to $200 per feu. The actual increases per trade will be communicated by end January.
Maersk’s Environmental Fuel Fee (EFF) and its quarterly Bunker Adjustment Factor (BAF) levels are subject to a monthly review and exceptional trigger if the price of VLSFO moves up or down significantly during the quarter. The trigger to activate the exceptional review on both cases is defined as a change of more than $50 per ton, up or down, on bunker prices compared to the last time both surcharges were adjusted.
The very volatile prices yesterday for VLSFO in Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub, stood at $646.50 per ton, down by $10.50 from the previous day."
Low sulphur fuel found to have higher black carbon emissions than HSFO,"January 20, 2020",https://splash247.com/low-sulphur-fuel-found-to-have-higher-black-carbon-emissions-than-hsfo/,"Mandated into law for less than three weeks and very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), shipping’s new number one bunkering choice, is already facing calls to be banned, especially in Arctic waters.
A submission made by Finland and Germany to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) suggests VLSFO has higher black carbon emissions than its forebear, high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO).
The detailed submission, funded by the German Environment Agency and assisted by class society DNL GL and engine maker MAN ES, shows that new blends of marine fuels with 0.50% sulphur content can contain a large percentage of aromatic compounds, which have a direct impact on black carbon emissions.
“New hybrid fuels with 0.50% sulphur content used in the study contained a high proportion of aromatic compounds in a range of 70% to 95%, which resulted in increased [black carbon] emissions in a range of 10% to 85% compared to HFO,” the study claimed. The higher emissions were most noticeable when the engine was running at less than full capacity.
The submission urges that aromatic content be included in the specification of marine fuels of the ISO 8217 petroleum standard.
The black carbon news has quickly seen a number of NGOs call for VLSFO found to have high aromatic contents to be banned for ships transiting Artic waters."
Weekly Bunker: 2020 starts with a bang,"January 6, 2020",https://splash247.com/weekly-bunker-2020-starts-with-a-bang/,"Its 2020. VLSFO is more expensive than MGO. #WorldWar3 is one of the highest trending tags on Twitter. Brent crude has jumped 3%. We’re in for quite a year.
But first, let’s focus on the world of bunkers. With vessels across the globe waiting impatiently at anchorages for fuel and bunker barges queuing up to load VLSFO, the bottleneck appears to be at the refineries’ ability to produce enough compliant product.
This has caused physical diffs between VLSFO and IFO380 in Singapore to rise from $170 in early November to $379 on Friday. Despite reports of tightening HSFO availabilities, scrubber supporters will start to feel validated in their decisions to adopt the technology despite recent bad publicity. Even though we hear almost daily reports from suppliers advertising new availabilities of VLSFO, it is clearly struggling to keep up with demand.
Since 10 December, VLSFO has been more expensive than MGO, from $34 under in early November to $10 more expensive on Friday. As MGO generally has a higher calorific value, better availabilities and less quality risk (note the recent sediment issues reported from VLSFO in Houston), shipowners should be flexible in considering it as an alternate to any Fuel Oil. For automatic up-to-date differentials at hundreds of ports around the world, send any port name to +44 118 310 0466 on WhatsApp and the BunkerEx bot will ping back a live price.
And if the local VLSFO differentials weren’t bad enough, in the time it takes a vessel to sail from ECSA to Singapore, owners could have experienced their bunker prices jumping by $182 in the last month.
A US drone strike at Baghdad airport killing Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, apparently as a “defensive” move, roofed the market with tensions in the region rising once again. Worryingly, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed “severe revenge”. It is widely predicted that Iran will now continue to disrupt commercial shipping in the Gulf through the use of military exercises.
Whatever your role is in shipping, having an up-to-date picture on bunker prices and compliant fuel availabilities around the world will be crucial to surviving today’s volatile market."
Value Investor’s Edge: Top stock picks for 2020,"December 30, 2019",https://splash247.com/value-investors-edge-top-stock-picks-for-2020/,"As 2019 comes to a close, J Mintzmyer, the founder of Value Investor’s Edge, is totting up the numbers in a year that has cemented his position as one of shipping’s top analysts. Value Investor’s Edge’s model portfolios are up 71% this year versus the market being up 24% and the shipping ETF up just 26%.
Research prices are set to jump by $1,000 next week so Splash readers keen to get in on the action for what promises to be a bumper year for shipping investments ought to sign up fast for a free trial now with Value Investor’s Edge.
Looking back on the past 12 months, Mintzmyer says the year stated out with shipping in a period of “irrational panic”.
“Sell side analysts were losing their jobs left and right. This setup offered a unique, perhaps generational, opportunity to invest in shipping stocks due to extreme pessimism which outweighed actual fundamentals,” Mintzmyer reflects.
At the start of 2019 shipping was experiencing rising rates in almost all sectors, coupled with near record-low ship valuations, near record-low stock valuations, and what Minyzmyer describes as a “promising pending regulation” in the form of IMO 2020.
The global sulphur cap – from a shipping investment play – is “massive”, Mintzmyer says, explaining: “It bifurcates the entire global fleet between modern eco tonnage and older ships with higher fuel burns.”
Furthermore, the opportunity to install scrubbers offers companies a chance to profit from the surging spreads between compliant VLSFO fuel and the legacy 3.5% bunker fuel HSFO.
“I expect IMO 2020 to continue to contribute to strong rates both due to increasing off-hire for retrofitting as well as slow steaming due to surging fuel costs,” Mintzmyer predicts. “Additionally, if rates show sustained weakness later in the year or into 2021, I expect demolition of older tonnage to surge as these ships will be clearly uneconomic.”
As for next year, the analyst is most optimistic for crude tanker and VLGC rates. Mintzmyer also has some hope for LNG carriers. “Sentiment has also turned incredibly sour in the LNG space, which I believe offers some very interesting opportunities for investors with longer-term time horizons,” Mintzmyer says.
When pressed by Maritime CEO for stock picks, in the crude tanker space, Mintzmyer believes Euronav is the most attractively priced at the moment, while in the LNG sector, he chooses Golar LNG and Flex LNG. We’ll be checking in regularly with this American analyst in the coming months to see how his predictions pan out."
Dangerously defective new fuels detected across Europe,"December 18, 2019",https://splash247.com/dangerously-defective-new-fuels-detected-across-europe/,"Europe is grappling with multiple cases of defective low sulphur fuel oil with the IMO 2020 regulation less than two weeks away.
FOBAS, the fuel verification company owned by class society Lloyd’s Register, has issued alerts this week about non-compliant fuels cropping up across the continent.
In Estonia, one ship using VLSFO made from shale oil encountered sludging, particularly during purification and around its filters. FOBAS warned there is historic evidence of fuel containing Estonian shale oil creating sludging issues and that other vessels are likely to face similar issues.
In Western Europe, meanwhile, FOBAS warned it had detected a number of cases of high and off-spec sediment fuels being sold at the port of Antwerp as well as at Rotterdam and Amsterdam. These defective types of fuel could result in excessive sludge deposition leading to engine and turbocharger damage."
IMO2020: How long will majors and refiners be able to bear the credit heat?,"December 11, 2019",https://splash247.com/imo2020-how-long-will-majors-and-refiners-be-able-to-bear-the-credit-heat/,"Will Hogg from Infospectrum on risk management in the sulphur cap era.
IMO 2020 seems to be providing oil majors and refiners with huge opportunity to return to being a force in retail bunkering. Let’s hope they are up for it.
When many of us started our careers in risk management, bunkering was comprised of oil majors with active retail bunkering arms, dealing with a relatively small number of well known owners and operators, with the remainder mopped up by the original independent bunker traders, who were prepared to leverage their knowledge and appetite for risk (plus hands-on risk managers) to make margins from this riskier “excess”. Subsequent spin offs from this core have all sought to use greater access to information or relationships to emerge into an increasingly complex sector, with all the major independents dipping their toes into this market (to varying degrees of success), and numerous nimble (and occasionally fly-by-night) traders entering and leaving the market over the last 20 years; bunker buyers have welcomed this extra competition, and margins in bunkering have narrowed as a result – at times to almost unsustainable levels.
Market participants have reacted in different ways to these very limited returns, and occasionally higher risks, on offer. Oil majors have tended to concentrate on wholesale sales to large-scale and what they regard as lower-risk enterprises, reducing the “hands on” nature of their risk management accordingly (some even folding marine fuels into their trading arms, whose risk appetite is based around very different models and security). Independents have, in turn, invested heavily in maximising their information and liquidity advantage, seeking to trade around the risk premium offered by lower-grade credit. As a result, the bunkering playing field has shifted; while oil majors and national oil companies continue to sell the highest volumes of bunkers, the retail market is now dominated by independent traders such as World Fuel Services Corp, the Bunker Holding group, Peninsula Petroleum Ltd and OceanConnect Marine.
The impact of IMO 2020
Multiple reports have suggested that the imposition of IMO2020 regulations may change this model, with oil majors (and, to a lesser extent, refiners) seeking to leverage their access to Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil to recover market share in bunkering retail. ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and BP have all announced significant investments in increasing refining capacity of VLSFO/ULSFO, increasing exposure to physical supply in key locations such as ARA, Fujairah, US Gulf and Singapore, and some even patenting the make-up of the fuel itself, and expanding bunker sales teams. Independent refiners have also sought to market their product directly to retail buyers. While such investments have caused concern amongst existing market participants, we have seen limited evidence that this expansion is being matched with an increased appetite for credit risk.
While oil majors and major independents have always used the marine fuel sector as a key factor of their fuel oil trading strategies (liner companies being particular beneficiaries of this strategy, despite their own risks), their perceived lack of appetite for risk in what is an increasingly complex and compliance-heavy sector is likely to be self-limiting. Will sufficient demand be generated by sufficiently transparent owners and operators? Indeed, some major refiners are already understood to be seeking assistance from traders in selling volumes that are not already allocated to key clients.
What next?
This situation is reminiscent of moves by banks/financiers to move into the physical and derivative freight markets in the heady conditions of the early 2000s – fine in theory, but more difficult to execute in practice; having traders grinding their teeth about an onboarding process utterly unsuited to the shipping markets (in terms of demands and timescale), isn’t good for business growth or employee/client retention. At our Forum in London, we speculated on how long it would take majors to bump up against their internal appetite for risk in the marine sector, and market conditions returning to the current “norm” of independents holding significant retail market share. Feedback suggested it would take no more than one or two years. With prices expected to be higher, and risks more complex, recapturing any lost market share will depend on the financial resources and intelligence of the independents concerned (witness the recent departures of smaller and/or financially stretched participants from the Singapore bunkering market). Top-quality research, and the accurate pricing of risk, will be a key factor in reestablishing these norms (or, conversely, allowing the majors to grow their share in the market)."
Weekly Bunker: Credit crunch approaching,"November 22, 2019",https://splash247.com/weekly-bunker-credit-crunch-approaching/,"Earlier this week 4 cargoes totalling 80,000 of VLSFO in Singapore changed hands in a single day, with Hin Leong buying 3 from Lukoil and 1 from Shell.
These were bought at $489, on a day when delivered bunkers in Singapore were indicated at $538 (+$49 premium).
As the rapid switch from HSFO to VLSFO continues, we expect to see this premium drop as competition kicks in between suppliers.
HSFO prices continue to slump as shipowners begin to calculate how much they need to last them to the final days of December and not a day more.
Structure is a good indication of market demand, and throughout 2020 we see HSFO in contango (weak demand) but VLSFO and MGO in backwardation (strong demand). No surprises there.
HSFO-VLSFO differentials are now $242 and converging nicely with Q1 2020 implied values, where we expect it to sit in the $250-300 range.
Considering this, we should start to see a ‘credit crunch’ on bunker financing soon. Buying 1000mt of bunkers now costs an owner an extra $242k. Across 10 stems, that is $2.4m of added financing that needs to be drawn from somewhere – so expect to see trader’s margins increase as they are the main credit and finance providers to the bunker industry.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose again as US stocks in Cushing fell dropped and fresh doubts about US-China trade talks continued.

Weekly Bunker: HSFO slumps,"November 18, 2019",https://splash247.com/weekly-bunker-hsfo-slumps/,"Even when everyone knows something is going to happen, it’s still fascinating to watch it come true. HSFO demand is beginning its long-awaited drop off and this past week we have begun to see the early signs of its impact on prices.
Spot differences between HSFO and VLSFO have risen dramatically from $170 last week to $247 now. All this has been from a drop in HSFO (not a rise in VLSFO) as the VLSFO-MGO differential remains narrow at $33.
October HSFO sales in Singapore were down 3% and it will be interesting to see just how big the drop is in November.
Meanwhile, sales of VLSFO nearly doubled. Many owners are carefully balancing their bunker stems so they don’t keep any HSFO come December 31 – remember, there is a carriage ban on HSFO so even holding it on a ship without a scrubber is breaking the rules.
Spot physical bunker premiums of HSFO and VLSFO are +$50 and +$57 respectively. The shift in prices this week has meant diffs are starting to converge to levels we expect to see in Q1 2020. However, you slice it (see the differential table at the bottom) we are now more range bound:
HSFO vs VLSFO sits between $247 to $296
VLSFO vs MGO sits between -$17 to -$66
All of these seem plausible.
On a macro level, we had a topsy-turvy past week only to end up back where we started. The first half was dominated by bearish news of US-China trade talks falling through. That then reversed as stats showed a drop in US crude production and inventory levels.
As a parting note: we seem to hear that buzzword “digital transformation” in shipping circles a lot these days. Well, we’re not alone. The graph below tracks how many times those words were mentioned in corporate earnings calls across thousands of industries (courtesy of CB Insights).

Ships slow down as higher fuel bills loom,"October 28, 2019",https://splash247.com/ships-slow-down-as-higher-fuel-bills-loom/,"Ships are slowing down as the global sulphur cap approaches.
“With the premium for VLSFO over HFO currently projected at c.$240/t across 2020, the industry fuel bill is set to rise, and speed again could be critical to the potential mitigation of increased fuel bills,” Clarkson Research Services noted in its most recent weekly report. Average speeds in some sectors are already down in the year to date, containerships by a 2% and bulkers by 1%.
Conversely, recent record crude tanker spot market levels have seen an increase in average speed by around 1% in the first half of October.
Average vessel operating speeds have dropped significantly since 2008. The average speed across the world fleet declined by 16% between 2008 and 2018, according to Clarkson data."
Weekly Bunker: Scrubber moment of reckoning approaches,"October 28, 2019",https://splash247.com/weekly-bunker-scrubber-moment-of-reckoning-approaches/,"If HSFO premiums are meant to get cheaper due to a drop in demand, we’re not seeing it yet. Physical premiums in Singapore were extremely strong at +$114 over November paper last week. Tight availability of HSFO is not unique to Singapore with the same story reported at major bunker hubs across the globe.
This once again makes the hi5 differential to VLSFO look cheap at just +$169 in the spot market, and VLSFO -$42 under MGO. Quick tip: for today’s levels, save +44 118 310 0466 in your phone as ‘BunkerEx’, open WhatsApp and send a port, e.g. ‘Singapore’ (our bot will reply with the latest prices).
We can’t help but feel the moment of reckoning will come soon in the great scrubber debate. Rumours swirl of HSFO suppliers pricing at extortionate levels because, well, what other choice does a ship with a scrubber have? If that’s the case, expect the hi5 to narrow significantly throughout 2020.
On the other hand we’ve heard of HSFO contracts going at ‘reasonable’ levels throughout 2020, so it will be fascinating to see what takes place as the year unfolds.
Implied levels of VLSFO in Q1 2020 using the spot blend margin of 20/80 HSFO/MGO gives a physical hi5 of +$256 and -$64 under MGO. However, if current VLSFO physical premiums (+$50) are maintained it makes VLSFO +$30 higher (+$286 over HSFO and just $34 under MGO).
In other news, oil prices rose in the past week as US crude stocks fell from refineries running more crude. However, any price increases seem to be in the shadow of weak growth forecasts leading to lower oil demand."
Weekly Bunker: Singapore gets back on track,"October 4, 2019",https://splash247.com/weekly-bunker-singapore-gets-back-on-track/,"Finally some respite for shippers as HSFO Singapore bunker prices went from over $500 two weeks ago to dipping below $400 this week.
Much of this is due to less concern around Saudi’s oil supply and a weak demand outlook as the financial world braces for another recession.
Specific to bunkers, Singapore has once again regained its place as the cheapest of the major ports in Asia after a few interesting weeks in which it was the most expensive (see differential graph below). It was a crazy period and never before had we seen such a flurry from operators to find alternate options.
Looking ahead to Q1, VLSFO levels look to be sitting between $50 below MGO (as it is today) or as low as $80 below MGO (using today’s 27/73 blend margin).
In either of those scenarios, the hi5 (difference to HSFO) becomes $220-$250. On the derivatives the November hi5 is actively trading around $240.
That differential could widen further as demand begins to shift away from HSFO. We can see the first signs of this as HSFO cracks are dropping down to minus $23-$26 and VLSFO cargoes are beginning to trade.
Interestingly, we’ve seen two physical cargoes of VLSFO trade in the window in Singapore at +$19 and +$6, yet delivered VLSFO bunkers are still indicated at +$56 vs 0.5% paper. Perhaps that will drop in the coming months as barges begin to switch over.

"
Weekly Bunker: Deceptive numbers,"September 13, 2019",https://splash247.com/weekly-bunker-deceptive-numbers/,"Physical premiums in Singapore continue to be extremely strong leaving many owners searching for alternate options. The graph below illustrates the trend of HSFO in Singapore versus a basket of nearby major ports.
Perhaps it was the jubilation of their National Day because since August 9, Singapore has been steadily rising and is now at relative 60-day highs.
Looking forward, this makes VLSFO ($547 today and $42 under MGO) look deceptively cheap versus HSFO (+$95).
We don’t anticipate HSFO physical premiums in Singapore to stay this strong come Q1 2020. Assuming HSFO drops down to +$30, this gives a ‘physical’ GoFo of $314.
Much of the talk at the annual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) has been about the 0.5% FO contract gaining liquidity and if the premiums stay steady, we can expect a big bump in the HSFO-VLSFO difference in January next year (currently $270) before reducing as the year drags on (the Cal-20 hi5 jumped to $245 this week as HSFO got sold off).
All of this is good news for vessels fitted with a scrubber as the ‘scrubber premium’ for TC rates grows.
In other news, flat price reacted to the prospect of Iranian crude once again hitting the market and weaker demand by dropping to $60 from highs in the week of $63.55 (Nov-19 Brent). As ever though, OPEC is expected to try and support prices with more production cuts.
Lastly, advocates of using wind as a clean way to power ships will be happy to hear that the vinyl is set to outsell CDs for the first time since 1986 – it seems older technologies can make a comeback.

Omegra: The benefits of being nimble,"September 11, 2019",https://splash247.com/omegra-the-benefits-of-being-nimble/,"Omegra was conceived in 2013 in Singapore as an independent dry bulk shipping company sitting alongside sister company and commodity trading house, Enerfo. From the outset, the aim was to be nimble, snatching opportunities in what has been an incredibly volatile market this decade.
“For any operator, success derives from the constant evaluation of market opportunity and a management structure that promotes the fast and clear decisions required to capture it,” explains Lukasz Ogryczak, a director at Omegra.
By the end of July this year, Omegra’s annualised cargo volume grew by 1.2m tonnes to 4.5m, outperforming the market, generating average daily earnings of just over $15,000 per day on panamaxes and $11,000 on supramaxes.
Currently, Omegra has 35 vessels – a mix in size ranging from kamsarmax to handysize – under commercial control with a combined deadweight capacity of close to 2.5m tons.
There are no immediate plans to enter ship ownership, but Ogryczak saying the company might change its stance in this department as the markets evolve.
“To date, Omegra has benefitted financially from being asset-light with a versatile time-charter fleet,” Ogryczak tells Maritime CEO. “So, the near-term answer to shipownership is no. However, with ever-changeable freight market conditions we will maintain an open-mind and keep an eye on sale and purchase pricing.”
On dry bulk shipping prospects through to the end of the year, Ogryczak reckons the solid summer end should percolate though to Q4.
“We believe bulk rates will remain buoyant for the balance of the year,” Ogryczak says, explaining: “The IMO 2020 situation points to an effective reduction in capesize capacity and any slow steaming in a higher cost environment may also tighten supply. The intra-market spreads should perform to some degree and at least sustain freight rates for the smaller sizes. The shift to MGO in Q4 – and VLSFO beyond – should also contribute to an increase in voyage and, ultimately, time-charter rates.”
The wildcard remains the US-China trade wars, Ogryczak admits."
Euronav leaves door open to ‘second mover advantage’ scrubber investments,"September 5, 2019",https://splash247.com/euronav-leaves-door-open-to-second-mover-advantage-scrubber-investments/,"Belgian tanker giant Euronav has detailed its ultra large IMO 2020 sulphur cap plans today, and, under new management, gave a hint that this erstwhile vocal opponent of scrubbers may still buy into the controversial technology.
The ultra large crude carrier (ULCCs), 
			Oceania, is currently off South Africa scheduled to reach Sungai Linggi, a Malaysian energy transhipment hub, by the end of the month.
The 441,885 dwt ship – one of just two ULCCs left in the world, both owned by Euronav – left Malta last month where it had been stocking up on IMO 2020 compliant low sulphur fuel for five months.
Euronav’s canny, early preparation for IMO 2020 resulted in it securing the new fuel for far less than current prices.
Hugo De Stoop, CEO of Euronav, detailed today how the company has purchased the equivalent of 420,000 metric tons of compliant fuel and marine gasoil to provide a substantial coverage of its fuel requirements during the initial period of the sulphur cap regulation, which is now bound for Malaysia near one of the key crossroads of the international tanker trades. The purchase value of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) was concluded at $447 per metric ton compared to a high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) bunker price of $400 per metric ton over the same procurement period.
De Stoop took over from Paddy Rodgers earlier this year. Rodgers had been one of the loudest critics of scrubbers. Under new management, however, there appears to be a change in view on the technology and that coming late to the scrubber party could actually prove to be an economic advantage.
In a release today, the company stated: “Euronav believes that it can still fully capture the potential benefits of an investment in scrubbers after the start of the regulation. At that time, the derivatives market of LSFO should have developed in size and in volume which allow Euronav to fully lock in the benefits of the spread at the time of making the investment. This should even provide Euronav with a ‘second mover advantage’ in learning the flaws of the first round of installations and take a decision based on facts without having to speculate.”
Other well-known critics of scrubbers have also relented in recent months. Mats Berglund-led Pacific Basin recently detailed how the company is installing the systems on its supramax fleet."
Maersk and Koole Terminals to produce 0.5% sulphur fuel in Rotterdam,"September 5, 2019",https://splash247.com/maersk-and-koole-terminals-to-produce-0-5-sulphur-fuel-in-rotterdam/,"Maersk Oil Trading and Koole Terminals today announced the signing of an agreement to produce IMO 2020-compliant bunker fuel, putting the port of Rotterdam as the centrepiece of the Danish shipping giant’s IMO 2020 bunker plans.
The production will take place at the Petrochemical Industrial Distillation (PID) unit, located at Koole’s Botlek site in the heart of the Port of Rotterdam. The toll distillation deal allows Maersk to produce VLSFO bunker fuel and will enable Maersk to further expand its bunker supply volumes in Europe.
Annual production is expected to cover 5-10% of Maersk’s annual fuel demand.
“The fuel manufacturing process allows Maersk to produce compatible low sulphur fuels that complies with the IMO 2020 sulphur cap implementation, reducing the need to rely on 0.1% price-based gasoil and fuel oil outside the ECA zones. Our activities with Koole will be an important driver in ensuring stable, reliable services for Maersk’s customers during a potentially volatile period for global shipping,” said Niels Henrik Lindegaard, head of Maersk oil trading at A.P. Moller – Maersk.
Last year Maersk and Royal Vopak, a tank storage operator, launched a 0.5 % sulphur fuel bunkering facility also in Rotterdam, Europe’s largest bunkering hub. This initiative will cater for around 20% of Maersk’s global fuel demand."
Monjasa acquires full ownership of five bunkering vessels,"August 28, 2019",https://splash247.com/monjasa-acquires-full-ownership-of-five-bunkering-vessels/,"Danish owner Monjasa has acquired the full ownership of five bunkering vessels in order to meet the growing demand for low sulphur fuel bunkering, a result of upcoming IMO 2020 regulations which will become effective bon January 1.
All five tankers will be deployed for continued bunker operations in Monjasa’s core markets in the Arabian Gulf, West Africa and the Panama Canal. Four of the five tankers have previously been on bareboat charter by Monjasa.
“With global marine fuel logistics expected to be challenged on parameters such as flexibility and storage capacity due to the introduction of the new Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) products, Monjasa is active securing the right tonnage for its long-term bunker operations,” the company said in a release.
The company took delivery of the first two tankers in Dubai this month, and the remaining tankers will be delivered during the coming months.
The five vessels are the 2009-built Aarhus, Delhi, Amsterdam, 2010-built Accra and the 2004-built Annie, and have a total capacity of 37,500 dwt.
“Last year, we increased our total supply volume by 17% to 4.1 million tonnes of marine fuel and we continue to see a growing demand for our services. This is also part of the reason we are now purchasing five quality tankers,” said Monjasa Group CEO, Anders Østergaard.
“We are on the brink of bringing new low-sulphur fuel products to the market and the entire industry needs to adapt to a new multiple products demand. These five tankers can segregate between two and six different types of oil products onboard and this contributes to making them an attractive investment for us. Coupled with an average age of 10 years the tankers are fully-furnished to handle the leap in quality required to perform bunker operations come 2020,” Østergaard added.
In total, Monjasa controls some 20 tankers globally of which 10 are fully owned."
HSFO availability tightens as sulphur cap nears,"August 14, 2019",https://splash247.com/hsfo-availability-tightens-as-sulphur-cap-nears/,"With 140 days until the start of the International Maritime Organization-mandated global sulphur cap, Splash has been hearing plenty of reports of the supply of heavy sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) becoming more tight, especially in Singapore, the world’s top bunkering hub.
July bunker sale figures from Singapore show the clear dichotomy in fuel choices – with 380 cst fuel oil grade down year-on-year by 140,000 metric tonnes while low sulphur fuel sales grew by more than 100,000 tonnes.
Online bunker buying platform BunkerEx noted in a recent report that the strong backwardation in 3.5% HSFO makes it unattractive to store, unlike 0.5% very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) which, BunkerEx said is in contango until January next year.
“This means suppliers are switching to store VLSFO, lowering the supply of HSFO and supporting the prompt market even more,” BunkerEx explained.
Chris Hudson, a fuel oil derivatives broker at London’s Freight Investor Service (FIS) noted in an interview with Splash that in mid-July lower residual fuel inventories dragged on Singapore’s overall oil product stocks to an eight-month low in one of the latest signs that suppliers are gearing up for cleaner to-be-launched marine fuel rules.
This then created an import drive towards Singapore, with net oil imports increasing fourfold in the middle of July. Fuel oil arbitrage volumes into East Asia were assessed at 5.55m tonnes in July, higher from June’s 4.62m tonnes, according to Refinitiv Oil Research assessments. Higher western arbitrage volumes were the main driver of the increase with a 77% increase in overall July volumes compared to the previous month, the assessments showed.
“HSFO production has been steadily dropping over the past few years, but the oncoming IMO switch over has sped up this process as fuel producers and storage facilities need to make room for a new grade of fuel,” FIS’s Hudson told Splash.
Going forward FIS expects HSFO to continue its relative strength compared to crude oil.
Cem Saral, CEO of Dubai-headquartered fuel resellers Cockett Group, told Splash he expects the tight availability of HSFO to become more pronounced in the coming months.
“Logistics adaptation onshore and waterborne is to accelerate for 0.5% segregation in storage tanks, barges and pipelines. There’ll be an accumulation of 0.5 fuel and 0.5 fuel blend components which will increase and add to arbitrage,” Saral predicted.
Saral also reckoned that the west to east HSFO arbitrage would likely shrink due to ports gearing up for the sulphur cap in the coming weeks.
A report from New York tanker brokers Poten & Partners earlier this year made clear the enormity of the coming fuel regulation, describing the sulphur cap for the oil and shipping industry as “implementing one of the most dramatic changes in product specification the world has ever seen”.
According to the International Energy Agency, IMO’s sulphur rules impact around 4.5m barrels per day of bunker fuel, equivalent to 4.5% of global oil demand.
According to a sulphur cap compliance timeline created by Wilhelmsen Ship Management, for non-scrubber fitted ships this is the month to finalise fuel switchover plans. Onboard bunkers need to be switched to compliant fuel in September and October with sea trials with the compliant fuel undertaken in November. Any fuel containing 0.5% sulphur and above must be consumed by December 31. The carriage ban on HSFO comes into force on March 1 so there may be some burning of this fuel in open waters in the first quarter.
In a poll carried on this site earlier this year, just 19% of readers felt the difference in price between HSFO and VLSFO would be more than $100 per ton by the end of 2020.
Earlier this year we published a special IMO 2020 compliance guide in association with Cockett Marine Oil to give owners unique advice to ensure they make the right decisions as the days tick down to the start of the global sulphur cap.

Reframing the 2020 operational debate,"July 17, 2019",https://splash247.com/reframing-the-2020-operational-debate/,"Cassandra Higham from Castrol gives the big picture viewpoint on the impending sulphur cap.
Very soon we will be measuring the countdown to 1 January 2020 in weeks, not months. As the view of the 0.5% fuel sulphur content cap sharpens on the horizon, owners and operators should be using these precious weeks to shore up their fuel options and bunker supply chain; and, in some cases, train their crews in safety and efficiently using scrubbers, if they have opted for their installation.
Among the reams of written words devoted to debate and discussion on the topic of the 2020 deadline and its implications for the shipping industry, much of the discourse has rightly been focused on a series of ‘known unknowns’; with fuel price spread, fuel availability, compliance levels, and the use of scrubbers among the most prominent. However, an area that has been arguably overlooked amid this seismic change in fuels is the acute effect the transition will have on wider operations – both in the implementation period but also aftermath of January 1.
As a vessel’s most costly asset, it has been well-documented that the reliable and safe operation of a ship’s engine is pivotal to successful fleet operation, with the commercial ramifications of any engine damage potentially resulting in delays and loss of day rates, debunkering costs, refits and potential litigation costs.
The sulphur cap undoubtedly brings with it new challenges to safe and reliable engine operation. Firstly, the fuel landscape will expand, from what was a market with two main fuels – Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and distillates, to a market that will see Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) added to the mix. Moreover, given that there will be more blended fuel in the market, fuel sources will most likely be more fragmented, and less traceable and transparent.
All of this presents both short and long-term challenges to operations. Owners and operators will already be working through their Ship Implementation Plans in line with the IMO’s recently released guidance, ensuring that their fuel and lubricants supply chains are planned out up to and after the implementation date.
The deadline should not, however, be seen as the end of the journey. The issues arising in the aftermath of the transition may take weeks or months to manifest. These issues could include corrosion, cat fines and other engine damage, and will require crews to redouble their engine inspection and used oil analysis regimes – something that the sector desperately needs to plan for.
It’s important to remember that these aren’t small operational changes that the sector faces. Given the complexity of factors at play, it is clear that a refocusing of the 2020 mindset towards examining engines holistically – in terms of hardware and its maintenance, lubricant, and fuels – is needed if shipping is to manage the implementation of the sulphur cap effectively.
Building knowledge of these interdependencies is crucial, because they have acute operational impacts for crews and financial implications for owners. The accepted operational and commercial rulebook for our sector will never be the same again, not least as the shipping industry looks ahead to decarbonisation in the near future.
This ‘new normal’ requires a new way of thinking that looks less at the engine in isolation, and more at the link between hardware, lubricant, and fuels. A new pace of change is also something that the industry must familiarise itself with, and, as months turn to weeks, preparedness for the post-2020 world will be critical. Anticipating the outcomes of all of this change will be crucial if the industry is to manage these transitions effectively.
The ‘what ifs’, or known unknowns, of post-sulphur cap operations present owners, operators and crews with important questions. To help the sector answer them, it is time we shifted the 2020 debate to anticipating the outcomes of the transition for hardware, lubricants and fuels equally, rather than focusing on January 1 as some ‘end point’ for change."
NYK develops Japan’s first additive for compliant fuel oil,"May 21, 2019",https://splash247.com/nyk-develops-japans-first-additive-for-compliant-fuel-oil/,"Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) and subsidiary Nippon Yuka Kogyo have jointly developed a new fuel oil additive for low sulphur compliant fuel oil that meets SOx emission requirements. Yunic 800VLS, which is patent pending, is Japan’s first additive for very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO).
Yunic 800VLS disperses asphaltene and paraffin (wax) specific within VLSFOs to suppress sludge formation, easing concerns about engines running into trouble when the global sulphur cap kicks in from the start of next year."
Live Animal Export: Can farmers find an alternative in only 40 weeks?,"March 25, 2019",https://splash247.com/live-animal-export-can-farmers-find-an-alternative-in-only-40-weeks/,"Livestock carriers have the oldest age profile in deepsea shipping. The sulphur cap should ensure many of them find their way to beaches in South Asia soon, writes Dr Lynn Simpson.
Another day of ovine gridlock on a sheep ship. No indicators, no brake lights, no problem; nowhere to go. Images like this will soon be historical.
Why? New regulations from the IMO that have me looking forward to New Year’s Eve. Get out the champagne!
The shipping world is currently fretting, speculating, hoping and bracing itself for the implications of the new IMO regulations to be implemented as of January 1st, 2020.
Less than 40 weeks away: about the gestation term of a calf.
Can live export farmers change their business models in that time and find alternatives? Are the exporters and industry bodies advising that the global carrying capacity of live animals by sea is expected to see an abrupt and significant decline and shift? In just 40 weeks time…
As a vet I never thought I would have to write about chemistry and physics after graduating uni, but here I am.
The new, colloquially termed, ‘IMO 2020 sulphur cap’ is the reason.
Based on years of global research, heated debate and ‘big picture’ environmental concern, the IMO will be implementing regulatory standards to ensure ALL ships in the world comply with new fuel emission standards.
The ships at greatest risk are likely to be the oldest. The live export fleet is the oldest saltwater fleet in the world, hence most vulnerable.
Less than 140 ships in the global fleet of over 100,000 ships registered with the IMO are ‘live export’ ships. A tiny percentage. About 40 are allowed to trade from Australia. The average age of a ship’s scrapping has been about 20 years, the live export fleet has an average age creeping above 40 years old. When the sulphur cap is implemented it is speculated than many of these 140 ships will be headed to the scrap yard beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. These yards are bracing themselves for a glut of ships to chop up.
Any live export ship that survives the new regulations by design or expensive mitigating strategies is not guaranteed to continue trading on its current route. The ships will ‘follow the money’. Any gap left in the EU or other areas may tempt existing Australian trading ships away. Where does this leave the farmers?
To meet the 2020 sulphur cap, and hence the Maritime Pollution (MARPOL) goals there are several options;
– Use low sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) or very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). These fuels are being produced in anticipation. Mothballed refineries being rebooted. Its more expensive – that cost will be passed down the chain. There are concerns that this fuel will not be compatible with some if not many older engines – some speculating it may result in leaks and an increase in engine room fires. One tactic to save money is to sail slower, reduce consumption- anyone familiar with live exports knows, more days = more deaths.
– Installing ‘scrubbers’ to extract the sulphur content from fuel emissions. Costly and depending on which type is chosen, fraught with further concern. The two types are ‘closed loop’, and ‘open loop’ scrubbers. Many of the older ships will simply find this not financially viable and scrap. The ships fitted with open loop scrubbers are facing growing concerns and limitations as places such as Singapore, much of China’s coastline and rivers, and Fujairah have already banned the use of this system due to water pollution concerns. The closed loop scrubbers are more expensive, and currently have no geographical limitations – they do require the shipowner to store and dispose of the extracted waste responsibly on land- more expense to be passed down the chain, less financial viability to any old clunker on its last legs.
So, where does this leave livestock producers in Australia? The UN/IMO have been discussing this change for years, it’s been well advertised, yet our agricultural industry does not seem to be factoring it into their business model. Why? Who has failed to keep them notified?
The live export trade is especially ‘on the nose’ in Australia. Allowable stocking densities for sheep are 17.5% lower than historically allowed. The industry itself has a self-imposed reduction (trade moratorium) of 100% reduced stocking density from June through to August due to belatedly acknowledged heat stress risks to or through the middle east during that time.
Yet the farmers are still concentrating on the small picture – their own interests. Why haven’t they been told the big picture, the true ramifications to their business? There have been attempts to ‘improve public perception of their image’ of late, by an amusingly named group calling themselves ‘The sheep collective’. Dictionary definition = mob. Why try to improve the image of a trade that is about to lose a huge transport capacity? Why not help them transition away from a dying trade? Live export of animals by sea is experiencing massive, sustained, and growing opposition globally.
The likelihood of scrapped ships being replaced is slim at best. With a growing acceptance and desire of imported chilled, frozen and diverse meats such as chicken- many of the traditional importing countries are already moving on.
To add to Australian farmers woes, on January 1 ,2020 new Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) regulations will see the end of double tiered decks. This will of course halve the carrying capacity of those decks. The Department of Agriculture has this month announced the requirement of electronic temperature loggers on livestock decks, all costly- again the cost will be passed down.
Reduced export destinations will mean increased welfare scrutiny. Hopefully a higher welfare outcome, however; more likely an increase in non-compliance exposés. More scandal and damage control pressure.
The global live export trade is likely to be turned on its head. No longer will orchestrated demand, drive supply of live animals – carrying capacity will. Its time for any sensible farmer to begin lobbying for onshore processing of their animals as close the point of birth as possible. Lobby for new infrastructure that is not at the whim of global shipping trends. Future-proof their operations and finally get some security for their animals welfare and business reputations by moving away from live exports.
This New Year’s Eve will be a game changer.

BP reveals low sulphur fuel offering,"March 12, 2019",https://splash247.com/bp-reveals-low-sulphur-fuel-offering/,"BP Marine will begin to retail low sulphur fuel designed to meet the 2020 regulation limiting the sulphur content of marine fuels.
BP’s new very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), with a maximum 0.5% sulphur content, has been successfully trialled in both Europe and Singapore. It will be sold alongside MGO and high sulphur fuel oil, and retailed globally.
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp will all have availability as will Singapore, Hong Kong, Salalah and Seattle. A full map detailing availability can be found below.
“BP supports the ambitions of MARPOL to reduce air pollution from ships and we have been actively working with partners to prepare for its introduction. We have undertaken a comprehensive test campaign, conducting ship-board trials of our new very low sulphur fuel. Following the success of these sea trials, and working closely with our customers, we believe we now have a robust commercial offer that will support customers in complying with MARPOL,” said Eddie Gauci, global head of BP Marine.
China’s Sinopec announced recently that it will start supplying low sulphur fuel in 2019, with a full supply available from Janaury 2020.

VLCCs predicted to be out of favour transporting fuel oil post-sulphur cap,"February 15, 2019",https://splash247.com/vlccs-predicted-to-be-out-of-favour-transporting-fuel-oil-post-sulphur-cap/,"Fuel oil in the sulphur cap era will increasingly move away from VLCCs, according to the latest weekly report from Alphatanker, part of AXS Marine, while in the run up to the new legislation Singapore, the world’s top bunkering hub, is seeing less fuel oil being delivered from Europe.
“The most apparent change in fuel oil trading patterns has been that less cargoes have left Europe bound for Singapore over recent months and according to market information, fixtures are likely to slump further over the coming months,” Alphatanker noted.
Singapore is the world’s largest bunker hub, where marine fuel demand totals around 0.97m barrels per day, with 380 cst on its own accounting for 660,000 barrels per day. While Alphatanker projects the Southeast Asian republic to remain the world’s largest bunker hub post-2020, the marine fuel demand profile will change significantly as marine gasoil and blended 0.5% hybrid products (VLSFO) become the most widely consumed products.
“Bearing in mind the aforementioned stock draws in the territory, it appears that bunker market participants are already running down inventory as they anticipate the shift in the marine demand mix. For this reason, we anticipate that VLCCs loading fuel oil in Rotterdam will become much rarer going forwards,” Alphatanker predicted.
According to Alphatanker data, although Singapore accounted for 32% of European fuel oil exports (not including European destinations) in 2017, this had slumped to only 10% by 2018 as flows diversified. This trend Alphatanker expects to intensify post-2020 as fuel oil use diversifies.
Globally, Alphatanker is predicting there will be a movement away from VLCCs for the transport of fuel oil.
“If there will be more intra-regional trade at the expense of long haul trade, this suggests that Aframaxes and Panamaxes will take demand away from larger vessels. However, if India and China do become significant destinations for Atlantic Basin-produced fuel oil, then the volumes and distances involved will favour Suezmaxes,” analysts at Alphatanker wrote in their most recent weekly report."
"As scrubber uptake becomes clearer, compliant fuel provision needs to step up","January 30, 2019",https://splash247.com/as-scrubber-uptake-becomes-clearer-compliant-fuel-provision-needs-to-step-up/,"Bunker demand in 2020 will be determined by scrubber usage, fuel availability and the degree of global compliance, writes Tim Smith, director of tanker and energy markets at Maritime Strategies International (MSI).
As the 2020 deadline draws ever nearer, some of the smoke is clearing around the options for adoption of scrubber technology and the response of the refining industry to the additional demand.
It has been hard to avoid the arguments around the technical, commercial and environmental impact of scrubbers but it in terms of actual installations, MSI expects about 10% of the tanker and bulker fleets (in deadweight terms) to install them. This will be concentrated in the larger segments of these markets with over 20% of VLCCs fitted with scrubbers at the start of 2020, and close to 15% of Capesize vessels.
Containerships will also see larger sizes attract scrubber installation – about 15% of +7,600 teu vessels are expected to be scrubber fitted by end-2019. With much lower scrubber penetration in the medium and small containership markets, the proportion of total containership capacity fitted with scrubbers by end 2019 is also expected to be close to 10%.
In other commodity shipping sectors, scrubber usage will mirror this pattern, with about 20% of the large (+40,000 cu m) LPG fleet fitted but minimal amounts of smaller tonnage. Cruise ships will see about 40% of the fleet with scrubbers installed by end-2019, the highest proportion of any shipping sector, with roro at 15%.
The concentration of scrubber usage in larger segments of main shipping sectors means that even though MSI forecasts about 2,000-2,500 ships to be fitted with scrubbers at the start of 2020, we expect legitimate scrubber fuel oil usage in 2020 to be close to 5-10% of total fuel demand. This is the primary determinant of high sulphur fuel oil use in 2020.
Nonetheless, explicit fuel oil use (not including blending for LSFO) is closer to about 17% of total demand, meaning we are still anticipating a significant amount of non-compliance. This is despite the important step in reducing non-compliance implemented in Q4 2018 when the IMO adopted a ban on carriage of high sulphur fuel oil in bunker tanks on ships not fitted with scrubbers. The recent bans on open-loop scrubber usage in China and Singapore add further operational pressure and economic uncertainty on scrubber usage.
Even so, specifications and pricing of 2020 compliant fuels remain a source of uncertainty. In 2019 we start to see significant volumes of compliant fuels introduced (likely in Q3/Q4). These are designated as very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), meeting the 0.5% regulation.
We expect production of these fuels to be driven by increasing refinery runs, blending (using diesel and high sulphur fuel oil) increased processing of sweet crude and refinery yield switching.
Refining capacity additions will help meet the challenges posed by increased diesel demand in 2020 with about 2.5m b/d of crude distillation capacity coming onstream in 2019/20. In some cases, such as Jazan in Saudi Arabia, this will be heavily skewed towards diesel production.
Increasing the refining system’s operational utilisation will also provide additional diesel. US refiners have been running at very high rates and have limited spare capacity. China potentially will be able to increase runs; its system has seen consistent oversupply in recent years leading to higher products exports, and is adding large units in 2019.
The global refining system is likely to be able to just meet aggregate incremental diesel requirements, but all the necessary levers will need to be pulled to do this. Market conditions for diesel are therefore likely to be tight and the path to absorbing the fuel oil overhang is less clear than the one to sufficient distillate production.
Adapting to this new environment is likely to lead to a shift in bunkering locations to diesel-rich regions (e.g. Middle East) as well as redistribution of oil products to meet requirements in diesel-short regions such as Europe.
MSI’s forecast fuel price spread through to 2022 shows over the period of history shown, the relative spread of MGO to HSFO has seen a decline. It has typically increased during periods of volatility in the oil market. As we have consistently stressed, the key determinant for shipping fuel costs in 2020 will be the underlying crude price.
The collapse in oil prices during Q4 stressed the fragility of this market and further weakness could provide more benign conditions for the switch to compliant (and relatively more expensive) fuel in 2020. Under MSI’s assumptions, we assume stability in crude prices in the $60-70/bbl range.
The differential between HSFO and crude drops at the same time reflecting the oversupply in the HSFO market. This does drive a sharp spike in the MGO premium versus HSFO, but in the subsequent years we see this premium decline towards recent levels. Notably, in the context of historical premiums, the spread between MGO and HSFO remains range-bound, albeit considerably higher, in 2020.
Although LSFO fuel specifications and prices will become clearer during 2019, we would estimate prices to be in the range of 10% below the MGO proxy shown here."
"2020 HSFO-MGO price differential likely to rise, but scrubber case still uncertain","October 5, 2018",https://splash247.com/2020-hsfo-mgo-price-differential-likely-to-rise-but-scrubber-case-still-uncertain/,"Ishaan Hemnani from BunkerEx has investigated where existing 3.5% HSFO bunker demand will go, how this will be replaced and what this means for prices.
The future cost of 3.5% HSFO could go as low as $220 per metric ton. The only markets left for 3.5% HSFO are power generation, which currently uses LNG and coal (approximately $114/mt). In order to compete, 3.5% HSFO will need to be priced at parity with LNG and coal which results in a price of approximately $220/mt.
Even with the uptake in retrofit scrubber demand and the widespread installation on newbuilds, the most optimistic figures indicate that 3,800 ships will have scrubbers by 2020.
Various estimates put 3.5% HSFO demand from scrubbers anywhere from 5-33% of total bunker demand (300-1,050kbpd) meaning at best 66% of 3.5% HSFO bunker demand will disappear (assuming full compliance).
1% LSFO, although not compliant itself will be blended with 0.1% MGO to create a 0.5% VLSFO. The demand for 1% LSFO is already reflected in the high spread vs 3.5% HSFO.
Even using a [technically incorrect] assumption that sulphur blends linearly, the mixes required to turn a 2.47% HSFO (global average) to 0.5% would be 83% of MGO and 17% of HSFO.

Therefore the use cases for 3.5% HSFO are low outside of power generation and it’s difficult to see any support for prices of high sulphur products.
The cost of 0.1% MGO could go as high as $900/mt from current levels. This is not just because more ships will run on 0.1% MGO but also for its use in blending to a 0.5% VLSFO (see table above).
Several majors have already announced they will have 0.5% VLSFO blends available in the major ports, however current blends are priced at near-parity to 0.1% MGO. In addition, the quantities available (whether delivered or ex-wharf) are a major uncertainty.
The IEA assumes 1m barrels per day of bunker demand will move to 0.5% VLSFO (out of a total bunker demand of 4m bpd) – i.e. 25% of future bunker demand will come from new compliant fuels.
LNG has been touted as a potential solution, however even with a high prediction on the number of LNG vessels (600 by 2020 – source: DNV GL) it still remains at <1% of total bunker demand.
As a result, 68% of bunker demand has to be fulfilled by 0.1% MGO – more than double what it is now.
The increase in 0.1% MGO bunker demand:

With refining capacity already strained and distillate yields at near-max levels, it’s likely to result in an increase in 0.1% MGO price by at least $120/mt in order to compete with other end consumers and incentivise higher refinery output.
This would cause the total spread between HSFO-MGO to be $680/mt creating a large incentive for both shipowners and suppliers to find a solution.
Although an increasing price differential between 3.5% HSFO and VLSFO/MGO may significantly decrease the theoretical payback time on a scrubber, there are larger issues and areas of uncertainty.
Consider that the top seven ports account for 60% of bunker demand (Singapore skews this number significantly). This weakens the case for non-compliance as a higher concentration of supply points is easier to police. Now consider the supply chain for Singapore of 3.5% HSFO.
3.5% HSFO is typically sourced from the Baltics or Caribbean and then transported to Singapore via VLCC. The East-West (Rotterdam vs Singapore 380cst price) typically trades at $20-30/mt to cover this freight cost. Will there still be incentive for this arb to be open with a low 3.5% HSFO price and extremely uncertain demand volumes?
Furthermore, the cargoes are then stored, broken down and sold ex-wharf in small lots to barge operators: will there still be barge suppliers dedicated to delivering 3.5% HSFO fuel?
Given the recent bad press about open-loop scrubbers, closed-loop scrubbers are likely to be the only option. This means ships will need chemical additives onboard, plus a sludge removal plan which can complicate operations and increase costs.
34 industry leaders from companies such as Maersk, Cargill and Trafigura this week committed to zero-carbon emission fuels by 2030. This surfaces another big question: will scrubbers again have to change, especially with space on-board already constrained?
BunkerEx, a company focused on technology solutions for bunker procurement has already seen demand from shipping companies for EUA, CER and VER Carbon Credits as a hedge against upcoming regulations.
As the supplier landscape changes, existing products will need to find new homes and prices.
3.5% HSFO will find its way to power generation and storage from refineries who have to produce it (this might be good for dirty tankers as floating storage). Existing flows of 3.5% HSFO will likely stop. 3.5% HSFO barges will likely switch to 0.5% VLSFO or 0.1% MGO.
0.5% VLSFO will be attractive based on its price differential to 0.1% MGO. However, this has key ‘known unknowns’ such as specifications (currently no standards) and stability (can two different types of 0.5% VLSFO fuel be mixed?).
0.1% MGO will likely be the dominant bunker fuel of choice however refinery supply restrictions will make this much more expensive. Fuel efficiency will be key as bunker prices rise.
LNG, although much talked about will likely account for <1% of demand in 2020. Its impact will likely be felt closer to 2030 as many newbuild ships have dual fuel engines and the supply network has time to mature.
With rising fuel prices, BunkerEx records calorific values of all fuel supplies to monitor variations between suppliers, ports and fuel types. This assists in assessing the true energy cost to shipping companies and can be compared on a MJ/$ basis."
